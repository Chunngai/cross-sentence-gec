Yesterday I started to learn Korean on the internet .
Yesterday I started to learn Korean on the internet . I just learnt alphabet .
I want to try to study both Korean and Japanese at a same time . Is it alright ?
Is it alright ? I found that the Korean 's alphabet is easier to write than the Japanese 's .
I like to learn foreign languages , especially English . But my English is so poor even though I 've learnt it for ~ 10 years .
I think English is most important . If I can speak both English and Japanese , I 'll have more chances to have a good job in the future .
But it 's also said that it 's very difficult to learn well both of them . When I studied Japanese for a short time , I often confused English and Japanese .
Especially , the Japanese 's katakana are almost took form from English , right ? But the way of speaking is different .
For this reason , we found it difficult to spell katakana , especially when we see a katakana word that does n't come from English , or the name of places and people . An essay which has too many katakana words always makes me bored .
I like English very much but I chose the Japanese department for no reasons . When I had to fill in the university entrance examination 's admission form , I even did n't know what I want to do in the future and who I want to be .
^ _ ^ . He is n't my own brother .
He is n't my own brother . I was acquainted with him in a Chinese 's room chat when I was at 9th grade about 4 years ago .
I was acquainted with him in a Chinese 's room chat when I was at 9th grade about 4 years ago . He is very special person , even though we 've met in real life yet .
He is very special person , even though we 've met in real life yet . He is 8 years older than me but he just likes a friend .
He is 8 years older than me but he just likes a friend . He is very humorious and handsome > _ < .
.. . That is the reason why I did n't choose English department despite I like it best .
That is the reason why I did n't choose English department despite I like it best . But in my university , at the second year of regular training , we can choose a second qualifications if we want and sure that we 'll be able to study well both .
My university has about 11 foreign language 's departments and some other department where teach economics , travel bussiness , computer and so on... If we 're learning a foreign language , we 're advised to choose the economics or travel bussiness 's department so that when we graduate we will have a best job . But If we want to study another foreign language , it 's ok .
But If we want to study another foreign language , it 's ok . So next year , I intend to choose English department for the second qualifications .
And when we 're at the third year , we have a compulsory subject . This is called " second foreign language. "
This is called " second foreign language. " It 's differ from the second qualifications .
Because the second qualifications also has economics , travel bussiness , computer... training and it is n't compulsory . The second foreign language is called compulsory subject but we can choose any foreign language to study .
The second foreign language is called compulsory subject but we can choose any foreign language to study . For example , I 'm learning Japanese , I have to choose one in 10 other foreign languages remained .
The compulsory subject just has 300 sections . It 's too little to learn almost the language we choose .
It 's too little to learn almost the language we choose . To learn almost Japanese , we have 4 years .
I also like French too . It sounds lovely .
If I have more spare time , I want to learn French . > _ <
> _ < Do you know our Uncle Ho who was able to speak fluently more than 10 foreign languages ?
I ca n't do like that but I wish I could learn at least 4 : Japanese , English , Korean and French . Do you think it is alright ?

I 'm going to have an end-of-term examination this month . I 'm very worry about it .
I 'm very worry about it . This time we still have to test 4 Japanese 's skill .
The result of last term , both 3 skills ( listening , reading , writing ) , I got good marks ( 9,5/10 each skill ) , but I just took 7,5/10 the speaking skill in spite of my easy topic . And the middle-term examination , my listening skill 's mark was 5,5/10 .
And the middle-term examination , my listening skill 's mark was 5,5/10 . It was so bad , was n't it ? And the essay 's topic this time will be random .
Next year I will be a " senpai. " > _ < Time waits for no one .
And life is short . We have no way except one way .

" Go to our room , I 'll turn off the TV and the lights "
A man 's bloody body lies on the road and next to him ; a young woman cries her lungs out while two policemen try to avoid her to look at the cadaver . Feeling goosebumps he turns off the TV and goes to their room .

① Although it 's gradual , various trials which seek out a form of education have begun in schools of each area .

Mistakes in a translation are n't of problems because it 's checked by a senior of mine at the end of the translation . The problem is that a sheet in Japanese Power Point material usually contains more information than English one due to utilizing Kanji .

Kanji shows many meaning by a word . Speaking to a example which I encountered today , I dealt with " 法 令 対 応 範 囲 . " ( 6 words ) It means " scope for the enforcement by Japanese law. " But if I try to enter the phrase in small box on a sheet of a Power Point document , the phrase can be entered with only small fonts which would n't be seen by remote audience when having a presentation .
So how to fit a small space bothers me every time to translate Japanese into English . Of course , all it takes is reducing or simplifying information in each sheet and trying to cover the gaps by voice .

Since everybody have to get off at the same time , almost all of places where people will go , such as any amusement parks , zoos , theaters , the roads people will get there and so on , would be hardly crowded . Although Japanese labor system has the same system of the " holiday of pay " applied to many foreign countries which everybody can take it at will , willingly Japanese workers wo n't get it supposedly because Japanese has assiduity basically and does n't go for acting alone such as getting a holiday with pay while co-workers works .

I think this is so inefficient that We should decrease national holidays and make getting a certain number of holidays with pay obligatory .

Couple of years ago I was very " international " girl , I had penpals from many countries , it was funny and interesting . After that I created account in LiveJournal and became part of Russian community there .
And I 've lost everybody I was in touch with from my " international " part . And I miss it .
And I miss it . Really miss .
Really miss . Even more , I started using Internet in 1999 and I started it from international part .

And the truth is Internet was the main thing that made me SPEAK English , me , who was learning in from early school years but could n't say a wold . The main mistake of our school here in teaching languages is that any foreign language is taught as a subject .
As a subject that has nothing in common with you . But in fact.. .
it 's pretty simple - any language is an instrument of communication . That 's all .
So I believe that this Lang-8 space will bring back " International " part back to me . Now the main question : how can I be interesting to the rest of people ?
Now the main question : how can I be interesting to the rest of people ? Of course , i can post more or less personal blahblah things here , but I 'd love to be more useful for the rest of community .
For example , for those ones who 's studying Russian or just interested in Russian reality ? What can I do for you ?
What can I do for you ? I can do small tasks , for example , to write small articles about any subject you 'd love to know from Russian part , or maybe I can take pictures of special places/things etc .

To Enter Taiwanese College There are two ways for high school students in Taiwan to enter college .
There are two ways for high school students in Taiwan to enter college . The first one is the admission .
Students who want to use this way have to take the GSAT ( General Scholastic Ability Test ) in each winter vacation . After the test , if you are satisfied with your score , you may start preparing for the admission interviews and your autobiography .
If it goes smoothly , you can enter college earlier and have 2 ~ 3 more months summer vacation . If it does n't , unfortunately , you have to use the second way to enter college .
It 's " much more " difficult than the GSAT . The GSAT only includes standard courses of the 1st grade to the 2nd grade in high school , but the DRT includes all of the courses .
Moreover , the DRT always puts focus on the most difficult parts of the courses , so most of the students rather give up courses of 3rd grade than take the DRT . After the DRT , students do n't need to prepare for any papers or interviews .
After the DRT , students do n't need to prepare for any papers or interviews . They only have to fill the departments they want to enter in the form on the website of UAC , and wait for the result according to their grades .
