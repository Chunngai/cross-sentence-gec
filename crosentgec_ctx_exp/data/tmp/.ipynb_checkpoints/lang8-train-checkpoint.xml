In this sentence, "And I love that" really means "And I love the fact that 味噌 is a special product of Aichi Prefecture." "that" really refers to an entire sentence, or an entire idea. On the other hand, "And I love it!" really means "And I love 味噌." In this case, "it" refers to the subject (person, place, thing) of the preceding sentence.

      <target langid="en">Even though I havn't watch this match, I am pround of the whole United team. -&gt; A better way to say this is "Even though I didn't see (or watch) the match, I am proud of the whole United team." It sounds more natural than "I haven't watched this match" because the match has already happened and is likely something you will never see. You can say "I haven't watched this movie" to suggest that there is a possibility that you might watch it in the future. But it's unlikely that you will watch a match you missed live so the nuance doesn't work here.</target>
