I would appreciate it if you could correct my sentences .
It 's been getting colder lately here in Japan. ( " These days " is a phrase I often hear Japanese and Korean native speakers use in their English , although in native English speakers would probably say " lately " or " recently. " It 's sort of the equivalent of 最 近 . )
I find Japan 's summer weather disagreeable because of its high humidity and temperature .
So , as the winter is coming , I 'm starting to feel better .
It is a very exciting season .
But , before enjoying those kind of happy times , I have to do a kind of boring,
I have a fiancee and she is finding a job. ( if she does n't have a job yet use " a " job , butif she has a job then use " her " job
It does n't seem easy for women to find jobs in Japan .
The first , most women have babies and they have to take maternity leave .
Employers do n't like it even if maternity leave is the right of employees .
The second , women workers likely to quit their job because of child care or the transfer of ther husbands .
If a woman worker quits her job , employers have to find a new employee .
Though there are many women workers who have excellent potential , employers often hesitate to hire them .
It is the first time .
When I first arrived in Brisbane , it was always sunny .
I am missing the warm weather .
It 's too hard for me .
My goal is an overall 7.0 , but it may need more than 1 year .
English is the harder , the more difficult language .
I really hope that I will be able to speak English like a native .
I also have another problem .
I always practice pronounciation , but it 's getting more difficult .
I dont know why I ca n't recognize " ea " " i " ,such as , " cheap as chips. "
If I said that sentence , people will hear the same pronounciation .
2 months later , I am going back to Korea .
I just learned the alphabet .
It is said that because the Korean grammar is similar to the Japanese 's , so that the Korean who study Japanese take about 1 year to speak Japanese fluently , while the other foreigners have to take 3 or 4 years or more .
I found that the Korean alphabet is easier to write than the Japanese 's .
How about the way to spell ?
And after I entered the Japanese department , I even ca n't recall any English grammar that I learned before .
But it 's also said that it 's very difficult to learn both of them well .
One time , I had a Japanese examination .
The Japanese who see a katakana word just spell it normally but we who had learnt English before see a katakana word , we just try to think of an English word and then spell it .
I like English very much but I chose the Japanese department for no reason .
Then I asked my brother for advice , he said that " I like Japanese .
I was acquainted with him in a Chinese chat room when I was at 9th grade about 4 years ago .
He is a very special person , even though we 've met in real life yet .
He is 8 years older than me but he is just a friend .
He is very humorous and handsome > _ < .
He can always make me smile even when I 'm in a bad mood .
But in my university , at the second year of regular training , we can choose a second qualification if we want and be able to study both well .
My university has about 11 foreign language departments and some other department where they teach economics , travel business , computers , and so on... If we 're learning a foreign language , we 're advised to choose the economics or travel bussiness department so that when we graduate we will have the best job .
So next year , I intend to choose the English department for the second qualification .
When we 're at the third year , we have a compulsory subject .
It 's different from the second qualification .
Because the second qualification also has economics , travel business , computers... training and it is n't compulsory .
For example , I 'm learning Japanese , I have to choose one of the 10 other foreign languages .
So , if next year I choose the English department , the year after I may choose Korean for second foreign language .
To learn almost fluent Japanese , we have 4 years .
After that , I am not sure that we can be able to speak it fluently .
It 's called " the love language , " is n't it ?
Do you know our Uncle Ho was able to speak fluently more than 10 foreign languages ?
I ca n't do it like that but I wish I could learn at least 4 : Japanese , English , Korean and French .
Do I have the ability to do it ? ?
I 'm very worried about it .
This time we still have to test 4 Japanese skills .
I 'm very nervous of speaking and listening skills .
It was so bad , was n't it ? The essay topic this time will be random .
I 'll have to write anything in Japanese as the topic requests .
Life is short .

We wore wedding dresses despite the absence of our bridegrooms. > _ <
I send my best wishes to her.. I know this might sound strainge , but this is a very common usage in English - to send someone good wishes on a birthday or other occasion .
Those are my mother 's pictures , which were taken when she was younger. Young is also correct , but the word younger is more polite , as it does n't imply she is so old now .
Is n't she beautiful ?

There is a big difference between the east and the west , when comes to education. I always admired how the westerners educate their posterity , their method is so gentle and kind , full of love and meaning , whereas the Asian method is more violent , for example the Chinese people believe that a child should be educated with rods !
Maybe our parents would never realize the trauma they had inflicted on us !
How successful was the League of Nations in establishing peace during the 1920s ?
The League of Nations was an organization formed to improve the lives and working conditions of people around the world , to work for peace through disarmament and to uphold and enforce the Treaty of Versailles .
Three of the most powerful nations in the world did not participate in the League of Nations : Germany,
However the League was unsuccessful because it largely failed to achieve disarmament .
The greatest achievement of the League was its work on social issues. No organization had ever tackled these problems before ; now their campaign has been taken over by the U .
N so it is a great success. However it failed to stop powerful countries starting a war , failed to establish disarmament and also failed to defend / uphold the Treaty of Versailles. These failures gave rise to aggression by the Axis powers .

On Tuesday , China condemned the honorary citizen award from Paris for the Dalai Lama , saying it posed " a grave interference in Sino-French relations. "
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said China was indignant and resolutely opposed Paris ' award for the Dalai Lama made despite China 's opposition. ( when a word ends in 's ' you only have to put ' [ For example James ' bike is nice ]
" Such a move stirs strong indignation among the Chinese people , " Qin said , inevitably , it would severely undermine the cooperation between Paris and Chinese cities , and gravely disturb China-France relations .
He said , China held a clear , persistent and firm position over the Tibet issue , which was related to China 's core interests and major political concern .
Qin urged Paris to stop interfering in China 's internal affairs,and immediately correct its wrong-doing .
Qin said that this move by the Paris government gravely damaged the city 's image among the Chinese .
A poll on the website of the Global Times found more than 87 percent of voters firmly opposed Paris ' move .
Paris should bear all the blame , Qin said , urging Paris to take the right attitude towards the Chinese people 's voices , and stop its offence to the Chinese people , in a bid to create an essential condition for the cooperation with Chinese cities .
The dialogue will include topics ranging from energy conservation and environmental protection , to finance and agriculture .
Since it was first convened in 2007 , the China-Japan high level economic dialogue has proven to be their most important mechanism for discussions on major economic concerns , and important regional and global economic issues .
Chinese Commerce Minister Chen Deming said , " I think we two sides can make joint efforts in the following 5 aspects .
Chen said , " China 's trade deficit to Japan was 34 and a half billion US dollars. ( You could say 34.5 billion US dollars )

I think that they mean " go back to the basics of making coffee. "
When my friends and I entered the cafe , we were surprised by it 's mood .
There was not any music .
It looked high-class .
We had lots of fun .
Today I 'll show you a photo of me playing guitar in my rock band .

Finaly , I went to Starbucks and drank coffee , ate a cookie and wrote letter for my boyfriend. There is no need to say coffee in Starbucks. Also , shop names , peoples names , titles of books and movies and so on always start with a capital letter .

I had fun on my day off

I went to the city with my friends last night because one of them left today .
It was kind of a farewell party for her .
The bar was very crowded because every drink was only $ 2 ! !

However , we are so sad that she left .

That 's a very short time. I do n't wan na leave , but I ca n't do anything about it .
After going back to Japan , I 'm sure I wo n't have any chance to use English .
Because in Japan , most of people are Japanese. ( or you could say , ... " most people speak Japanese. " Just a suggestion , it 's a little clearer ) .
I hope I can make friends overseas though .

Do you know " The little prince " story ?
The little prince lives in a small planet. There are two small volcanoes and a rose .
He waters the rose and protects it from cold weather .
And prince decides go away from the rose .
Then I wondered what the rose means on prince 's planet .
And I checked it on the internet .
He died by a planned accident .
So he loved her so much .
It is famous for fireworks .
So my friend and I went to see it .
The festival was near the river so it sounded nice to go to .
But it was difficult seeing some fireworks because some buildings were in the way .
So we went around to find a better spot .
We were able to see some good fireworks .
And there were many foreigners who came to watch .
I talked to a foreigner who is from Taiwan .
We will meet again at another festival .
It was nice to meet him ( her ? ) .
When I arrived at LAX , I rented a car at the Dallar rentcar ( rental car ? ) shop .
After an hour later , I had a flat tire
and I needed to change my car .
I called the rent-car ( rental car ? ) office and the officer said " You should return here and you can change it to another car .
Where are you ? " thatwhy. ( I 'm not sure about this part , maybe that is why )
I could not change the flat tire to a spare tire .
He is supposed to send somebody to my place .
I did not know where I am... .
I asked the neighbor who was walking nearby .
I could change the flat tire to the spare tire by Road Server and return to the shop .
I could switch the car to another car .
I thought I would need a navigation system on the car .
Finally I could meet my friend
at LA .
I went to see a baseball game with some of my friends at KOUSHIEN
I did n't like baseball until I watched the game .
That why , we were singing a song , when the players were standing at the butter box. ( batter box ? )
all player has each song one of player had a homeback hit. ?
The team we were rooting for won. ( rooting for = supporting , hoping would win )
the title is " The beauty and the beast "
It is famous f in the world
Most people know it
Then I have searched for its related information on the internet
One of it said the story originated from the Greek myth
The story has a maxim .
That is you should believe your feeling instead of what you are seeing

I have been to Tokyo .
I sometimes visit there .

I have lunch at Tsukuji market to eat sushi. ( Not to sure why your capitalising these words ? )
I tried to eat KAISEN-DON
One of my friends recommended it to me but I was a little about trying it .
It is good. Is o.k , however , 'I did enjoy it though'. would be a better sentence .
When I was back in my home town of Osaka,
I saw a girl who seemed to have a problem .
May I help you ?

Ｉ had a chance to talk with a customer from Korea .
He could speak English , so then , I tried to ask " Would you like to have a cup of coffee or tea ? "
But the person sitting next to me , a Japanese businessman , interpreted my English to English .
I need to keep practicing my English speaking .
festival in the neighborhood
We had made a festival by ourselves at elementary school .
There were so many shops and game stalls such as Takoyaki , Yakisoba , Oden and Frankfurters .
such as Takoyaki,Yakisoba,Oden,Frankfurter. ( Combined with last sentence. )
We were responsible for selling Tonjiru , which is a Japanese-soup .
It was such hard work .
But many children seemed happy .
I had a good time. ( Sounds more natural. )
I began to learn English when I was about 16 years old .
I have had English for about four years now .
For four weeks I was in the UK to learn English .
I was in Cambridge and learned a lot !
The school I was in was the studio school .
Since last year , I have had a really bad English teacher.. .
In my opinion , my English skills have decreased since I have had this teacher .
So I began to learn Japanese by myself .
I learned more Japanese then English last year .
I do n't have a Japanese teacher , but I think I learned more Japanese than English since I have had this English teacher .
At the moment , I can write all the kana and about 200 kanji .
But just the meanings and how to write them .
I think it 's easier to learn step by step .
So I learn the vocabulary , grammar , and the meanings of the kanji .
Also , I listen to JapanesePod101 .
It 's very helpful because I do n't have a Japanese teacher .
The pronounciation is very difficult to learn without anyone who can speak japanese .
While I am learning Japanese , I do n't want to forget English , so I write here to improve english .
My English teacher ca n't really help me.. .
I am affraid that I am not good enough to write in Japanese .
You see , I write all in Kana because I did n't learn a lot of kanji .
I hope I will learn a lot of Japanese !
The research was about " Fourier transformations and Digitral image processing " !
I will write about it in my next journal !
It 's a long-running special-effects TV series aimed at kids .
They assume the identity of a grasshopper-like cyborg .
They kill each other to gain special powers which grant any wish. ( Since I 'm not too familiar with the series I 'm not sure if there can be many powers or not , so I 'm guessing some parts here. > . < )
One fights to revive his sister , one fights to cure his incurable disease. ( If you want to make it more general , with 'some ' : Some fight to revive their sister ( s ) , others fight to cure their disease. )
Each drive has a characteristic ability .
For instance , " Cyclone Memory " which improves its speed , " Metal Memory " hardens its body ,etc .
And they fight while having a good command of 2 of them .
They can only insert 2 drives at once .
It tickles my engineerity ! ( Ha , I guess I know what you mean by 'engineerity ' ^ _ ^ , but maybe something more likely would be : 'engineerness ' ? This is n't really a word either , but I think I would use that over an 'ity ' ending. For something proper , maybe 'it tickles my engineer character ' , 'it tickles the engineer in me ' would be better- ^ ^ )
When I was going for a moonlit stroll this night/evening , I heard that " bell-ringing " crickets were singing .
When I went for a moonlight stroll tonight , I heard " bell-ringing " crickets singing .
I recognized that the summer is finally ending and the autumn is falling/coming/following .
I 've heard that no one enjoys the songs of the crickets besides the Japaneses .
I 've heard that no one enjoys the singing of crickets besides the Japanese. ( " songs " is n't bad , but when I think of " songs , " I think of songs made by singers and bands. )
So , I 'm wondering what you actually feel when you watch this video .
Do you know what is a cross bike ?
These days cross bikes are growing in popularity amongst the Japanese .
Cross bike is shaped like a breed between a road bicycle and a MTB. ( MTB = mountain bike ? )
But this cross bike is used more for travelling within towns. ( ? )
I had wanted one for months .
And finally , I got it ! ! !
The shop staff told me that this was a hot-selling item this year ! ( ... a best-seller... )
I rode back to home on it right after I purchased it from the bike shop/store .
It was a 30 minutes ride .
It was great to ride on the roads !
There were n't any bumps on the road , so I could go really fast !
But I often had to stop and look back because there were so many taxis and cars parked on the streets .
My bike does n't have a stand , so I carried it all the way to the front of my apartment which is on the 3rd floor .
The frame is aluminum-made , so it is as light as a feather !
I 'm still have a headache .
I 'm still having a headache .
I 'm going to absent from classes tomorrow .
I 'm sorry that I could n't reply to your comments and message for a few days .
It was a three days and 2 nights event. [ " Three day , 2 night event. " Just to let you know , you can also write it this way and omit the " and , " using a comma instead. A lot of times , you can even omit the " s. " ]
( This is such a wonderful thing to do ! ! )
I was struggling with errors until the ( very ) last train. ( " very " is for emphasis , your sentence is perfectly fine too )
When I came back/reached home , it was already past midnight .
Then I had a light supper. ( we always say " light supper , " but never " small supper. " I wonder why... )
It 's already half past 4 am now .
This is just the beginning. [ Since you 're being specific about what kind of beginning here. ]
Inside the shrine , there was this treasury that contained lots of treasures .
And 神 道 is very much related to 天 皇 ( the Majesty the Emperor ) . ( It 's a bit odd to use " deeply " here... )
Therefore many arts and works have been dedicated to 天 皇 conventionally .
Yes ! The samurai swords were really cool !
Me neither. ; p
But I did n't become tired at all ! ( It 's more common to use " grow weary " )
It was a really comfortable/relaxing place. ( " Snug " is used for other things. Like , this is a snug sweater = > tight-fitting , or body-hugging. )
Then we went to 栄 which is downtown Nagoya and my junior joined us .
There is this large Ferris wheel in the middle of downtown Nagoya .
Although she had longed to ride it so much , she had a fear/phobia of heights .
So she was rather quiet when we were inside the gondola the whole time .
( Why bears ? )
I wish they felt the same as me too !
When I got home , it was already past 12 : 00 am. ( If you use 12 : 00 , you need to put " am/pm " because it can mean 1200 hours or 0000 hours. Otherwise , you can say , " past midnight " )
The seniors sometimes link daily things to technical terms. ( I know ! )
For instance , when a guy was acting bashful/shy/awkward while he was talking about his girlfriend , the others hooted at him like.... .
Then the guy retorted with.. .
I am still self-restoreable ! " ( Hahahaha ! ! )
I am so glad to to be incorporated as a member of the lab ! ( It 's a little weird to use 'incorporated ' , because it sounds too formal and business-like. You can say , ... " to be part of this lab ! "
I do n't understand the lyrics , so I ca n't translate but somehow the English sentence feels weird to me... could it be perhaps , " Aiming at the core through a synthesizer " ?
What I think she wants to say is , it 's easy to be in the charts or follow the crowd .
The most important thing is to create songs which never get outdated and are admired by everyone irregardless of time or people .
OH MY GOSH ! * * Always say " GOSH " for this ! The other word has distasteful meanings. * *
OH MY GASH ! [ It really should be " gosh , " but it 's the internet and written in a certain pronunciation..so it does n't matter. ]
It 's already 2 : 34AM now .
I 'm going to lead the group discussion tomorrow .
Also , I have a big presentation on this coming Wednesday .
And there is a huge pile of/amount of homework due Thursday. [ Need something to indicate how much homework. " Huge " does n't really do that here... ]
. But there 's also some good news !
There is only one good news. [ " One " is more specific versus " a " which is not specific. ]
Love and the Japanese language !
Japanese , however , had n't have the proper word which signifies " love " then because of the sensibilities and lyricism. ( sensibilities and lyricism ? )
I think what he meant was that " love " is the feeling that makes the moon looks brighter than the moon you ( usually ) see by yourself .
Continuing from my previous journal entries..... .
Really ? I did n't know ! : D
So they must have had a great time there .
They had a free day on Friday because their flight would depart on Saturday afternoon. ( It was Saturday morning , actually )
When they got down the bus , they looked really tired .
I thought it was because of the long mountain route/road .
I had other choices in mind,
But I decided to take/bring them to Atsuta Shrine .
So many people go there for a stroll .
I turned on the TV immediately .
My favorite soap opera starts at 13 : 30. ( If you want to talk about a soap opera that is currently/recently a favourite , then it 's usually more natural to keep it in a separate sentence from a time reference.

What did you do with your mother ? ( * ^ _ ^ * )
I went to a revolving sushi bar named " ざ ぶ ん " with my family and mother 's mom and father 's mom ! ! ! !

I need to go and buy it when I 'm in Japan then ! : )
This sentence is grammatically correct , but a bit ambiguous as it can either mean 1 ) your friend is sick and hospitalized , or 2 ) your friend is working or for some reason , is in a hospital although s/he is not sick .

Somehow the police officer remembered it .

We just took the graduate school entrance test last week .
After the test , we had an interview .
During the interview , the interviewer told us if we did well or not at the test .
So , what I have to do now is only research !
By the way , I have something to ask you .
Do you believe that there is a right thing in this world ?
Like the moon , things look different from different viewpoints .
We ca n't see the whole thing at once .
Scientific speaking , we can only perceive by the reflection of light .
Scientifically speaking , we can only perceive by reflection of lights .
What I wan na say is , a right thing might not be right for others .
So , I bought a book called " A Theory of Justice " !
I have n't read more than 2 pages yet .
I 'm trying to finish this book within this month .
I also started attending English conversation class !
There are so many things to write about !
One journal entry is not enough to finish up writing about my days !

I had to wait there about 2 hours .
Then I went to the dispensary to get some medicines for the prescription which the doctor wrote me. ( I do n't believe this sentence is ungrammatical but it is definitely odd sounding to me. )

So I do n't have much time to write this journal entry because I have to get ready to go school before I go to bed. ( Again , not necessarily ungrammatical but this can also be read as you are planning to go to school tonight BEFORE you go to bed. Perhaps something like " I have to get ready for school tomorrow and go to bed. " That would clear all possible confusion .
So I do n't have much time to write this journal entry because I have to get ready to go to school before I go to bed .

And now she is a freshman at Luther College .
I had n't ridden a bullet train in a while. ( Use " I had never " when it was your first time ever )
So I was worried that I might not see her... ( I think it 's more natural to use " I was worried that ... [ bad thing will happen ] . " Or maybe " I was worried about whether I could see her or not " )
Today was the first day of my lab 's school year !
This is the website of the lab. ( This is the lab 's website./Here 's a link to the lab 's website. )
The areas of research of this laboratory are Electric Power Equipment and High Electric Field phenomenon .
I 'm in my 4th year at Nagoya University now. ( I 'm a 4th year student at Nagoya University now./ I 'm a NAgoya University senior now. )
I 'm inexperienced and my research competence/skill is not high enough .
So I am going to knock myself out learning as much as possible from great professors and seniors ! ! !
My dream is to be a professor in the field of Electric Power Equipment and Asset management ! ( Both field or area are ok in this context , but region is probably best avoided. )
I hope everyone had a great Christmas Day !

Today I went to the YFU meeting for overseas students who are staying long-term here in Japan .
They arrived here 2 months ago .
And they are going back this winter .
Wow... I ca n't. > <
We talked about why they decided to come to Japan and what they liked of Japan .
Most said that they really love Japanese food !
Fortunately , the Japanese art exhibition was held on the same floor of where we were having the meeting .
And it was for free for all to admit. ( Or , " admittance fees were not required " / " It was free of charge " )
So I brought everyone into the exhibition .
So if you blow at it , it will be destroyed !
And he took the pictures of us for free ( too ) !
And then they treated us to matcha and cha-gashi !
It was a really good experience .
And I really appreciate their kindness !

Many individuals believe that nuclear power plants are a considerable danger .
The Chernobyl disaster left unforgettable damage due to the explosion of the plant and the release of radiation .
Many countries , however , decided to reconsider nuclear power plant development .

But if I keep writing like this , I think I will get a good score on the TOEFL test !

I bettered my own TOEIC score ! ( More natural may be : I beat my own TOEIC score record ! )
The day before yesterday , the results of the 153th TOEIC test was announced on the internet !
The score of the TOEIC will be converted into the score of the English section .
What I meant is I am finally ready to concentrate upon the entrance examination for graduate school .
We held a 2 day orientation of the YFU exchange student program .
I met some former friends from high school .
We talked about our senses of value. ( More natural : We talked about our values/values in life. )
And we talked about our future careers .
My grandpa passed away. ( Even if it 's expected it 's probably better to avoid saying 'finally ' because it gives the impression that not only were you waiting , but also hoping for it to happen. And that 's not so nice. : / )
I am going to see the cherry blossoms with my lab members and professors ! ! !
I transferred to the 3rd year of Nagoya University from Toyota National College of Technology last year .
So last year I experienced my first campus life !
At the beginning of the school year , I had almost no friends at the university .
But now I am aurrounded by many friends , seniors and juniors !
I received so many greetings yesterday. ( It 's good to remember with 'i ' and 'e ' that : " It 's i before e , except after c. " It 's a rhyme we learned in school. ; ) )
From friends , family , friends in US , my host family and so on .
Those made me realize I have been supported by so many people ! ! !
And those gave me plenty of motivation ! ( It depends on if you 're talking about the people or the congratulations you received. If people , then " And those really gave me a push ( when I needed it ) ! " or if the congrats : " And those really pepped me ! " for example. )
I am going to set about taking the math section of the entrance examination for graduate school tomorrow !
It 's been 2 months since my last journal entry .
Time flies very/really fast .
I 've been through so many " exciting " experiences these days. ( " stimulative " is a little unnatural here... )
But this margin is too small to contain all my experiences... .
Fermat 's theorem ! ; )
I 've been concentrating on my graduation research ( recently ) , staying overnight in the lab twice a week. ( adding " recently " makes the sentence smoother )
( And the pains ! ; p )
Going to an Amusement park with exchange students !
I had to do so many tough stuffs like doing a presentation in front of all of the lab members and professors .
I had to do so many tough things like doing a presentation in front of all of the lab members and professors .
But they never stay long enough in my brain .
I feel contented by reading the English , but in actual fact , I learned nothing .
I guess I need to put more focus on studying English .
The highlight of the rides is the roller coaster called " Steel Dragon " !
It was in the Guinness Book as the world 's tallest , fastest and longest roller coaster .
Some of the beams ? were broken .
I am not good at such rides .
But one of the exchange students who is from Michigan really likes those kind of things .
So I was dragged along too .
I chickened right in front of the platform once .
I had been having a fear for a long time .
I had a prejudice for a long time .
It was way more fun than I thought !
It was way more fun than I thought ! [ " funner " is not a word. ]
It 's been a while since the last time I wrote in my journal .
I 'm sorry I have n't been able to give you any help for a month .
But I 'm done with all of my exams .
This means the beginning of 2 months of spring break ! ! !
I 'm trying to write a jounal at least once every 3 days !
And I 'll try to give you any help I can !
By the way , I found some beautiful lines written by Miyazawa Kenji .
But I do n't know how to put them into English .
Flowers raining in the sky , we call them stars .
Stars shining on the earth , we call them flowers .
Something like that .
What the Japanese government said and what the foreign press said differed in many accounts .
Maybe the Japanese government has been trying to control information to avoid a panic,
but this backfiredand
many people are disoriented. or possibly " disconcerted ? "
The Tokyo Electric Power Company was one of the most reliable large companies,
but that day , it failed .
Now , nothing is certain .
In addition to my last journal entry , my birthday happens to coincide with the end of the cherry blossom season , so all the cherry trees are in full blossom !
I went to the park with my friends to enjoy a picnic under the cherry blossoms on my birthday !
The park was congested with many people. ( It 's okay to use 'congest ' , although I personally find it a little weird. Another word to use is " crowded " )
So it was not as if I could enjoy the pretty gardens .
But people were having fun with beer bottles in their hands and the foods of nearby stalls !
But they still have hearts to love and enjoy having fun with friends ! ( I do n't quite understand this sentence.. )
this was not what I was going to write.... .
So , see you then !
[ PR ] My best friend 's band is releasing their major debut album on 4/21 ! !
He is one of my best friends !
We went to the same school and had been in the same class for five years .
I wrote a journal entry about him and his band a while ago .
At that time , I asked you for some help for the name of the major debut album on his behalf .
He hopes his songs will be the fire and warmth in your heart .
Enjoying our lives is " an " important thing .
But while we live in " a " nation , there are responsibilities and obligations .
But while we live in our own country , there are responsibilities and obligations .
I really " have to " reflect " up " on myself about this .
The subject was " Is it possible that each of the people all over the world to use the same amount of energy that a Japanese uses now ? "
At no distant future a time may come when people will use up all the oil .
But if the blade is damaged by lightning and needs replacement , the wind must be slight enough to undertake the repair work safely .
This means that operating a wind power generator requires constant and powerful wind but it must be stopped periodically .
So I think I should go to bed a bit earlier tonight .
I will write more about the energy problem sometime soon .
I have appointment with doctor tomorrow morning .
I have a doctor 's appointment tomorrow morning. ( I think your sentence is okay ! )

Furthermore , my graduation research could be a kind of simulation stuff,I think. ( Sorry , do n't know what you are trying to say )
Furthermore , my graduation research might involve some simulation stuff which would need a high-speed processing computer,I think .
( YES ! )
But I decided to do it to save money !
But it 's gon na be much more powerful than the ones made by manufacturers !
I 'm thinking of using some wire shelves which I 've kept outside .
They are covered badly with rust
I have a BBQ and hiking ( to do ) this weekend .
I guess this is gon na take a while .
I did n't have a refrigerator,
and so , I used to take my meals at the school cafeteria , or just buy some convenience food .
And by gigantic city , I mean ( it 's ) Tokyo .
Feng-Sui derives from China,
Feng-Sui derives from Chinese long time ago. ( or... Feng-Sui came from [ was derived from ] China . )
But has been used in Japan since medieval times .
Where the queer monk , 天 海 , rearranged the whole city of Edo under the Feng-Shui 's doctrine .
To make the long story short , he changed the names of places around the castle .
He also placed many temples and Japanese style gardens under the Feng-Sui style .
Though many Japanese are not aware of it .
I was at the " Tacos Party " last night !
All the participants works for YFU as volunteers .

The second picture is the handmade tiramisu ! ! !
One of them recently had his/her birthday .
It was not only tacos party , but also her birthday party !
It 's been a week since the last time I wrote a jounal .
Last Thursday , I went to a party
The party was to help us practice English conversation !
These kind of parties are held periodically .
But this was my first time to take part in one .
And I waited for them about 30 minutes in the cold wether .
We could drink as many drinks as we wanted .
I drank litres of Gin and Tonic !
We just had English conversations !
But also it was fun to talk with Japanese people who are interested in English !
I forgot that this was my firtst time and enjoyed speaking English !
Those pictures were takenthere .
( I am the guy who is accidentally kissing the 42 year old guy in the second picture. )
Around 22 : 30 , people started leaving. If they did n't , they would miss the last trains .
Then wemoved to the next place !
We walked about 10 or 20 minutes with a straggeringly ! Lol - i do n't know what you 're saying here ! : )
We talked about many funny things ( mostly indecent things ) there !
We stayed there until morning !
I have TOEIC test in a month .
But the computer which was provided for me by the lab was really slow .
I tried to uninstall some applications and did a virus check ( too ) . ( It will sound more natural if you add " too " at the back of your sentence )
It took a couple of hours. ( This is a set phrase , " a couple of ... , " " a set of... , " " a dozen of... " etc etc )
Then the workshop started .
When I got home , it was ( already ) past 10 p.m. ( ＞ , ＜ )
I still could write a journal entry but I was too exhausted .
I need to be more steady ! ! !
And sleeps for only an hour .
He says his bed is too comfortable so
He might sleep for more than an hour if he sleeps in the bed .
I do n't know if an hour is enough for me .
I feel proud of Japan 's culture .
I feel sad for the loss of that culture .
I also feel sad for the loss of those culture .
There are many different theories regarding what motivates human beings to act in the ways they do .
Ultimately any kind of human action is molded by affection from others .

Most people say Eminem is one of the coarsest rappers in the history of music because of his behavior , words and songs which are studded with insults .
He has affronted/insulted many celebrities in his songs such as Michael Jackson , Elvis Presley and even his ex-wife. " Put affronts upon " might not be incorrect ( I did n't check ) but it sounds awkward .
A song on his 3rd album , however , shows insults might be not his real intention. I think people usually say that a song is on an album , not in it .
This song which you might have not heard of is named " Hailey 's Song. "
" Hailey " is his daughter 's name .
Please turn off or put your cellphone into silent mode while watching the music video. ( I think " show " is for something longer --like a TV program. )
" Hailey 's Song. "
There is a huge forest where no one can trespass its holy ground in the middle of a capital city which is well-known worldwide .
The priest is a direct descendant of the world 's oldest dynasty , and he is also the only emperor who exists in the whole world now .
There are three holy durables called " The Three Sacred Treasures. "
Those are owned by the emperor and have been passed from generation to generation .

I feel like they are doing such things just for fun ( only ) .
The First thing that I want to emphasize is there is no difference between a whale and a cow .
Biologically they are both classified as mammals .
Do you think it can be used as a reason to not kill it/them ?
We have the culture to appreciate ( ? ) all lives equally .
April 1st is the day known as April Fools ' Day .
But I am not going to be a fool in this journal .
April is the beginning of school season .
I graduated from Nagoya University and got the degree of Bachelor of Engineering last month !
I graduated from Nagoya University and got my degree of Bachelor of Engineering last month !
Now I 'm going to graduate school at Nagoya University .
Now I 'm going to go to graduate school of Nagoya University. / Now I 'm going to do my graduate studies in the same university .
I learned many things last year .
I also learned more than just academics .
My aim for this year is " learn a lot , and play a lot " by using efficient time management !
Midterms are finally over with ! ( When you say " I am over with midterms , " this actually means " I am fed up with midterms ! " and " I will never study for/write a midterm ever again ! " What I wrote is closer to what you meant , I think. )
Finally , the mid-terms are over now .
But not this year .
But not for this year. ( Do not start sentences with , " but. " You should join this sentence with the previous one. )
This year , it means , I can finally focus on my research !
How about , " Optimization of strategic maintenance of electrical equipments " ?
My research is about the optimization of the maintenance strategy of electrical equipment .
I have no idea how to solve/go about doing this yet .
I have only 5 months to finish this .
So I have no time to repose ! [ Although , " repose " work--it sounds odd in everyday language. I think a better word to use would be " rest. " ]
So I have no time for repose !
So I have no time for rest/play ! ( agree with previous commenter ; repose sounds too... formal and elizabethan ? )
So I have no time to relax ! ( the suggestions above are great , too )
I have n't touched my electronic dictionary these days .
I have n't touched my electrical dictionary for some time. [ with a " have n't done " phrase , we usually use a time phrase starting with " for , " as in : for a while ; for some time ; for the last few months ; for ages ; for a whole month ; et cetera ! " These days " just does n't work in this situation ! ]
This means I have n't used English for some time .
Learning English is unavoidable for my future. ( It 's a bit awkward to use " not avoidable " where you can use " unavoidable " IMHO )
I have to spend more time on learning/my English ! ( This sounds more natural to me )
It has been really cold until last week .
In the middle of April , It 's usually warm enough to go out with wearing only a long-sleeved shirt or sometimes a casual jacket over here .
But on the day of last week , it was so cold that I needed to wear a down jacket even though it 's already spring ! ( I think an exclamation mark is more suitable here ; p )
Today , the professor of the energy transforming engineering class told us some of his doubts on global warming .
He described it from the viewpoints of the number of the sunspots , the axis of the earth and the earth 's yearly spins ( ? ) .
He said that the earth is facing a global cooling now ( instead of global warming ) . ( It will make your sentence more complete if you add the blue words behind )
He said it will induce a rather cool summer all over the world .
The weather forecast said tomorrow is gon na be cold .
I just ca n't wait for the nice warm spring !
We took part in it under the YFU , ( the comma here makes the sentence easier to understand ) which was the exchange organization that took care of me while I was staying in America .
I have been told that we were supposed to explain the activities of the YFU to students who were interested in studying abroad .
We held such a meeting last month .
So we thought that this would proceed as easily as last month 's meeting .
But it was n't/did n't .
Actually this event was like a kind of extracurricular activities to the highschool girls .
There were a lot of other organizations such as the Japanese drum players , the welfare workers and a rival organization that is called AFS !
But all of them were mostly for people who wanted to study abroad .
So the contents of slide show/presentation which we prepared were mostly about how to apply for the YFU exchange program , the history of the YFU and the structure of the organization .
So it was a serious type of thing and was n't a fun at all .
The rival organization , AFS , on the other hand , was doing really fun stuff .
We totally misunderstood the purpose of the event .
We felt as if we were lying on a bed of thorns .
Last Saturday , we held a Christmas Party for the exchange students !
Last Saturday , we held a Christmas Party for exchange students !
There were nine exchage students staying in the Tokai area through YFU .

Three years ago , I went to America for a year as an exchange student through YFU .
I really appreciate to them !

So , to repay and express my feeling of gratitude , I 'm working for YFU as a volunteer now !
So , in exchange,and to express my feelings of gratitude , I 'm working for YFU as a volunteer now !
These exchange students are returning homeat the beginning of next month .
So we wanted them to have one more precious memory of Japan < to take home with them > !
That was why we held the christmas party .
This was why we held a Christmas party .
A previous YFU exchange student now runs a cafe in Nagoya , he let us use his hall for the party

When I hoped to study abroad in America , he was the one who approved and paid all the expenses .

He took one look at me , and suddenly he stormed about my hair color !

He could n't overlook that I seemed to have changed my identity and lost my pride in being Japanese .

I have never faced such a situation before , that someone who is really close to me is dying .
I have never faced such situation , where someone who is really close to me is dying before .
At first , I kind of lost my grasp of what I was facing .
I could n't think of what I should tell him .
I could n't think of what I should say to him .
Strangely enough I have n't been terribly grieved this week .
Strangely enough I have n't been terribly upset this week .
Because I was too busy with my university stuff and other work I 'm responsible for .

Today I had my third English conversation class !
Today was my third English conversation class !
We talked about an article , " Asian youth forgetting how to write. "
First we were given a piece of paper ( where an article was printed ) but some sentences ( were left blank ) .
First we were given an article that had some sentences blanked out .
And we filled ( in ) the blanks .
And we filled in the blanks .
Oh , there is ( homework ) due next week .
Oh , homework is due next week .
My favorite one is , " There was a sign on the lawn at ( the ) drug re-hab center that said 'Keep off the Grass'. "
Today I went to the Atsuta shrine and the Shiratori Japanese-style garden !
A Shinto shrine is a structure built as the house of kami-sama .
A Shinto shrine is an architectural structure that is used to house kami-sama. ( Another way of saying ; p )
It 's only an hour from my house but I had never been there before .
I love your photos ! ! ! : )
I felt like " the true colors of Japan " were there ! ! !
I felt that one can see the true essence of Japan there. ( Another way of saying )
Can I walk on this bridge ?
Here are some rules about paying homage at a shrine :
There are some rules about paying homage at a shrine. ( I think your sentence is okay )
2 You must walk on the left side of the road because only the kami-sama may walk in the center .
2 You have to walk on the left side of the road because the center ( of the pathway ) is for the kami-sama only .
Then tap your hands twice , bow and make a wish with your desire in your heart .
Then clap your hands twice , bow ( again ) and make a wish from the bottom of your heart .
After you make your wish , you should n't say it outloud .
When you are making your wish , you should n't say it out loud .
These are some of the conventions of Shinto .
But I saw many people who did n't follow them .
( I will learn from you ! ; p )
Japanese-style gardens are often made in imitation of the real scenery .
And this is the biggest Japanese-style garden in Nagoya that imitated the scenery of this area .
It has a quaint atmosphere .
It has a quaint ( and lovely ) atmosphere .
I think leaves of the trees will be really beautiful when they turn in autumn
I think the leaves of the trees will turn red in autumn and it must be really beautiful then .
Because if I touch you I think everything I 've established is gon na collapse .
That fear could alienate you .
If I had got on you in my birthday suit,
If I had got onto you in my birthday suit,
being held by you until the moon set over the sea , and shared the panorama of the color of the sky,
I would not be feeling this gloom .
( Oh ) How many more sleepless nights will I have ?
I can not concentrate on anything else ; I 'm just so in love with you .
I 'm not in a good shape .
This morning I woke up with a horrible stomachache .
So I ran into the bathroom as soon as I left the bed. 他 の 言 い 方 : So I rushed into the bathroom the moment I left my bed/woke up. ( This is slightly more natural but your sentence is okay too )
So I ran into bathroom as soon as I left the bed. no need the ?
I did n't feel good since last Saturday .
This happens periodically/occasionally .
It 's like , only the air around me becomes very thin .
I ca n't focus/concentrate on my studying/revision .
I was n't able concentrated on my study
On the day of my birthday , I decided to never fail to write a journal entry everyday !
This was way I was in a hurry last night .
This was when I was in a hurry last night .
This waswhy I was in haste last night. ( ^ - ^ ;
It is the biggest priority for me to keep my promises !
But I will keep it up ! ! !
I will try to persevere through ! ! ! ( Using " undaunted " is a little weird here.... )
Now it 's 12 : 30 in Japan !
Or , " I do n't know what else I can say... "
It might be the best movie I 've ever watched. [ or " ever seen " ]
I have watched many movies. [ or " have seen " ]
So I do n't know how to comment on it .
Actually , Radiohead 's Last Flowers is used as an ending song for the film .
I 've heard that Hollywood is remaking it with Daniel Radcliffe and Nicole Kidman .
I 'm sure it will fail .
Because I 'm sure that it is impossible to make this movie except in Japanese/in Japan/for a Japanese audience .
What I 'm trying to say is , even if you are a great chef , you ca n't make a Japanese dish with American seasoning .
There is only one thing that I am sure of .
It is that I am glad I could watch this movie .
Perhaps I had been there before , but I did n't remember anything of it .
They looked realistic. ( They looked like the real thing. )
Then we moved to 栄 and went to the restaurant which serves a cake buffet !
They served more than 15 kinds of cakes and we could eat as many as we wanted ! ( I think in all cases , instead of 'serve/served ' , I would use 'have/had ' instead. Serving implies that it is handed over to you in person. And usually that 's not the case with a buffet. : ) )
They served cream puffs , custard puddings , short cakes , and many other cakes which I had never seen before !
The clerks ,customers and everyone in the house sang birthday song together .
We had plenty of cakes and a great time .
They had a free day in Nagoya because the flight would depart this afternoon .
Depression
These past few days , I have been very tired .
Our school 's rock club declared that I becomethe activities ' leader next year .
I have to host our club 's Sea Music Festival activity. .
I have a lot of things going on right now : Activities Club , schoolwork , relationships , etc .
I felt so tired and cried several times .
How can I do it ?
What can I do ?
How to Make Friends Titles are capitalized .
When I was young , I found it very easy to make a new friend .
However , it 's more and more hard now .
Why ? , I think it is because of the lack of trust .
When we are little , we even do n't know what is right and what is wrong .
In the other words , we can say we are childlish .
But when we grow up , everything changes .
I think the only way to solve this problem is empressement. ( Empressement is a bit strange )
But I feel very happy , because I have
A reply to a letter ^ ^
Now I am thinking about my reply to the old lady.... .
After the year changes , we will hear this greeting everywhere .
When the year changes , we hear this greeting everywhere .
On January 1st we get New Year 's cards from friends and family .
These greeting cards are usually made in December .
We write about our present condition and thoughts , and print photos
on colorful greeting cards .
I 'm sorry I have n't contacted you for a long time .
All the Japanese know there are a lot of people
And we appreciate their ongoing support , rescues , relief efforts and so on
All the Japanese are working together,
and are wishing for the revival of our country .
And I hope you 're in good health .
They looked very excited .
However , all the children became very quiet
It was the last content. ( HUH ? ? )
I work as an MOT ( Microsoft Office Trainer )
The day before yesterday , I helped to make an examination list of Pigeon Racing .
The fastest pigeon can be back from 1400K away in only 2 days .
I was very surprised , not only by the distance , but also by their speed !
Now I am trying to translate a letter from an old American lady
But I can not understand what she says... .
What does she wish her letter would be different from ?
Does she think my letter is not good ?
She is a Christian , and I am a Buddhist .
So I wonder if she meant to say " Merry Xmas..... "
A : Hi , my name is Jonathan Kellich. < -- " Kellich " is just what it sounds like. I have no idea if that 's what it is .

Yesterday I was given a lot of adzuki beans by my neighbors : )
So I tried cooking the Japanese sweet , " ZenZai , " for the first time in my life .
I washed the beans and boiled them ..... .
I did n't know that the beans expand after boiling them .
I did n't know that the beans would expand when they were boiled
As soon as my husband saw them , he shouted , " Who can eat all of this ! ! "
oh Wikipedia taught me that Zenzai is called " red bean soup " : )
We eat it with chopsticks .... .
Please list what you consider to be the most common pets that people keep. ( " owning a pet " is OK , but " keeping a pet " is more natural )
In my country , dogs and cats are popular as pets .
They have a long history of living with people .
They have been with humans for long long ages .
Not only because they have been a companion,

The test took place at the college I graduated from .
After the test was over , I had about an hour before my husband would pick me up .
So I visited a coffee shop I had used to visit
It is named for a North European tableware maker ^ ^
The shop keeper told me about Herend , so I told her that
I used to come there when I was a student .
We talked abou our current situations .
Thanks for a peaceful time .
environmental science , economics , biology , and international law .
I was late for my environmental science class because I overslept this morning ( > _ < ; )

On my way home , I bought sushi and a side dish at half price from the supermarket .
Today , I went shopping with a friend .
On April 15th , when the new semester begins , I need a new bag for carrying textbooks and PC .
But I could n't find one that I like .
Although there were many bags in the shops , I did n't feel that their designs were good .
I plan to buy a bag via the internet shopping .
Actually , my original name is not Don,
it is Dong Chun Kim. That is my Korean name .
You may feel that my whole name is not easy to pronounce , so therefore , I have abbreviated it to Don .
Wanting their offspring to live following the meaning , what the name means is the first priority when Korean fathers give to their sons .
If somebody asks me what makes me feel happy in my life , I would saythat it is delicious foods that make me happy .
I love not only the flavor of it , but also the atmosphere when I haveeat itwith my friends .
While eating we also drink alcohol , chat and , of course make joke .
What I hate most in the Universe is the rat,

There were many people there ! !
I like playing the piano .
I began to play the piano at 6 years old .

I like Chopin 's music .

Yesterday there was an athletic meet in ( at ) a Japanese school. ~ ( if it was inside the school then it should be " in " if it was outside the school then it should be " at " ( was not sure if you said what you meant ) ) ~
But , it was delayed until next week .
But , they were delayed until next week .
Because it was raining .
I was very shocked .
I was very shocked .
My friends were too .

I hope next week it will be sunny ! !
I hope next week will be a sunny day ! !
I went to the pool recently,
because it was hot !
It 's nice to go to the pool during summer ! !
But it 's raining this afternoon,
so we could n't go to the pool .
I think I need to learn English.. .
I read English books too,
because I learn English from it !
Because it is English study for me !
The homework for Japanese school is very difficult .
There also a lot of homework to be done .
This ellipses ( ... ) is not necessary
It is so shocking to me .
We went shopping .
It is very cute !
It was full of trees and nature .
We were able to see deer !
There were a lot of insects.. .
We headed to the waterfall .
It was beautiful .
Today was tiring,
My best friends are in Japan .
I email them every day .
Maybe they will come here next summer !
Please tell me if I can say this sentence like this !
I know I can say this sentence like this. .
But can I say it like this ?
This is the best learning method for English .
Today , I had a quarrel with a friend who I have known for about 2 years. You could say " one of my friends , " but you add a more detailed description afterwards , so the " my " is not necessary. It is more grammatically correct to say ... " a friend whom I have known... " but this may sound too precise. Very few native speakers of English use this grammar rule any more .
I met with him on the yahoo chess site , and we became friends .
We used to go to swimming together at the beach sometimes , and at that time we were good friends. OR We went swimming.. .
He is a foreigner and has lived in my country for a_long time , but he can not speak the language very well , so we usually talk in English .
But I noticed that he sometimes makes bad remarks about my country , and says bad things about our people .
Everytime I heard him say things like this , it was due to a misunderstanding , and I would explain to him : " What you said is not accurate... " " such things " is a bit formal. " I would explain " means " I used to have the habit of explaining "
he did_not change.. .
But it did not work well , and our relationship finally collapsed.. .
I do not think that we can rescue our relationship .
It really is sad .
It is not easy to find foreign friends in my country .
so I was happy to have him as my friend. I have changed the wording so that you do n't repeat the same expression. The meaning is still the same .
I know that different countries have different customs , philosophies , and all that , " and all that " is rather casual speech. Coming immediately after a serious word like " philosophies " it implies " this is a serious subject , but I do n't want to make it heavy. "
so I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt in order to maintain our friendship. If you " give someone the benefit of the doubt " it means that you are not sure if the person is right or wrong ( there is a doubt in your mind ) but you decide to agree with the person anyway .
Of course I am not a perfect person , and I have my faults , but I could n't accept what he said.. .
Thanks for reading this. .
and if you have a similar experience , tell me something about your notion. ( Instead of " tell me something about your notion , " try " tell me what you think " or " tell me what you think about this " )
and if you have a similar experience , please tell me something about it .
I taught English to my junior high school students and I found this in the dictionary .
'walk ' has the meaning 'to make something walk'. ( or , " walk " can also mean " to make something walk " )
Of course I know the meaning of the word 'walk'
but I did not know that it also has the meaning 'to make something walk ' like in that example .
when I am teaching English , I am also taught a new things by my students .
Today I got to know about this site at a Korean internet cafe .
Many friends would be able to correct my diary entries , and I would be able to correct a Korean learner 's entry too !
I just started learning English at an English academy , hence i get to converse with native speakers/with a native speaker .
Speaking , however , is so hard for me !
I had nothing to do so I stayed home all day and studied English grammar and memorized English words !
She was born in the Heian period .
Sei-Syonagon wrote a famous essay , Makurano-soushi .
Sei-syounagon served the Queen , Tyugu-Sadako [ Tyugu = Queen ] .
When Sadako 's siblings were transferred to remote place , Sadako decided to become a nun and enter a convent .
In Heian period , to kill oneself is forbidden , so people who wanted to die were supposed to be become a nun and enter a convent. As a note spaces go after commas , not before .
But Sei-syonagon , when a man of power proposed her to serve another , never separated from Sadako , even when a man of power proposed she serve another .
Her loyalty is lost in modern Japanese spirit .
In her essay , she wrote only beautiful memories .
I do n't think so .
What do you think about this story ? OR How do you feel about this story ?
Today , I went shopping to buy a key ring , which has a sample food , with my friend .
What is " Sample foods " ?
What are " Sample of foods " ?
It is a fake of meals or foods like the photo above .
It is a fake replica of real meals or foods shown in the photo above .
In Japan , there is usually a showcase of sample foods in front of a restaurant .
They are very similar to real meals .
I have heard that foreign tourists are surprised to see them .
And , it is not cheap , a small key ring costs over 700 yen ( about 7 U .
And , this price is not cheap , since a small key holder price is over 700 yen ( about 7 U .
It is because they are handmade .
A professional sample-food makers make each of them by their hands .
A professional sample food maker make each of them using their bare hands .
We went to buy it for our native teacher from Urudu .
He is leaving Japan this winter .
So we wanted to give him something very Japanese .
So we wanted to give him something that reminds him of Japan .
I start to produce myself. ( produce yourself ? ? ? a little bit strange )
I had to translate a poem , 'Lines Left upon a Seat in a Yew Tree ' by Wordsworth , into Japanese .
I always struggle with translation especially when it comes to poetry .
English is a very useful language when you try to express your feelings because one word has a lot of meanings , but when you try to analyse poetry or something , it 's so hard to find out what a word really means , I think .
I do n't like to mention anymore about my studies for now .
I love both beer and wine , but recently beer does n't suit me ( anymore ) .. .
Maybe it 's because I 'm not young enough to drink a lot of beer anymore ? ?
It was a wine from Barcelona because I remembered one of my friends from Catalonia recommended it to me one day .
If you read this , I 'm sorry my diary is not an interesting one , but I would like to recommend you the bottle of wine which I mentioned above .
" Hana " is a flower. ?
She sometimes eats grass in my yard .
But , I love my pet , Hana .
I must make an original CD .
It has to have English songs on it .
I ca n't find any good songs in English .
Please tell me some good songs .
I want famous songs .
Because I do n't know any English songs. ( you could leave out " Because " and it would sound more natural )
It 's called " ANGELS AND DEMONS. "
I am going to take pleasure in it. ( " enjoy it " sounds more natural than " take pleasure in it " )
Next , I want to watch the movie. ( This phrase is better. )
Also , I want to read new books that Murakami Haruki wrote .
Also , I want to read the new book that Murakami Haruki wrote .
The book 's subject is " 1Q84. "
The book is called " 1Q84. "
I turned twenty .
And I do n't like beer .
But , I will try to drink delicious shochu with tonic water !
Trip to Hong Kong
In fact , my wife comes from Hong Kong .
We have n't visited her hometown in years. ( Is this what you meant ? )
In the beginning , I could enjoy western styles of foods like bread , cheese , and pizza , but after some time , I started to miss Korean foods so much .
However , Korean foods were quite expensive and it was hard to find Korean restaurants .
I think a lot of foreign people face similar difficulties in Korea if they come from small countries .
They have something like congee , a lot of noodles , and many sea-oriented foods ( " seafoods " ) .
I still remember a course of 12 dishes we had at a banquet in Hong Kong .
I started to study English during my first year of middle school. ( More typical would be to name the grade/form ( ? for British English ; I 'm an American ) , as in " I started studying English in the sixth grade. " )
It was very/rather late compared to students these days. ( " Compare to , " " contrast with " )
Now they start to learn English at a much earlier age--even in preschool or kindergarten .
That may be the reason my conversation skills are not as good as my reading and writing skills. ( Haha do n't ask me why it 's usually in the plural ; it just is. : )
I think any language should be acquired at an early age , at least before the child is 10 years old ; otherwise , it will be a difficult task for him to speak the language as fluently as native speakers do. ( Good job on getting this sentence structure correct. )
Hopefully , I can improve my English writing skills and help other people with their Korean writing .
This ritual comes from Chinese Confucianism .
We have grown up reading Chinese novels like " Sam-Kuk-Ji , " and " Seo-U-Ki. " Even some old people were very proud of saying they read the book series for several times .
Some people believe that the Chinese are physically larger than Koreans .
Around 10 years ago , I had my first chance to meet Chinese , from both Taiwan and from mainland China .
They spoke a language I did n't understand , which made me wonder how the people of our two nations communicated for thousands of years , and at how much our cultures shared .
Frankly , I got impression that they were poor and tiny , but I started to enjoy their food , especially food from the " Schezan " area .
There are situations when I need to speak English .
Nowadays , we have many guests from overseas , especially China and Korea .
So , I recently began to study the Korean language , but I must admit that it is quite challenging .
One day , I will write a submission/diary in Korean .
Barium
Yesterday morning , I had a regular medical check-up and drank a lot of barium .
It tasted terrible and gave me discomfort in the upper abdomen .
After I drank a lot of barium , I had to be rolled sideways three times on the stage of the X-ray equipment .
After rolling , the X-ray study was started , and I had to be rolled sideways a number of times for observation .
After the X-ray study , I had to take strong laxatives .
Since the ( doctor ? technician ? ) said that I had to drink three liters of water that day , despite my full stomach , I had to drink a lot of water .
Yesterday was a heavy day for me .
I am very happy .
However , my salary was reduced by 15 percent to ease the companies financial crisis .
Then , my allowance was reduced 20 percent by my wife .
I can not drink as frequently with my subordinates anymore .
I will buy small cakes for my wife ( and family ) , and I hope I can negotiate an increase in my allowance .
I bought the blue-ray/hard-disk recorder on installment last year , and will keep repaying my hire-purchase agreement from my allowance .

My daughter skipped ahead/advanced two classes in swimming club today. ( " Skipped a class " usually means サ ボ っ た . I think you mean " advanced " or " skipped ahead " to a higher level class ? )
She goes to the swimming club every week and she masters the breaststroke , backstroke and butterfly stroke .
Three years ago , she used floating tubes .
It is difficult for me to master a new thing .
The library
The public library in my town has mail reservations and a delivery service .
If I want to read a book , first I access the library 's website .
Then , I search for the book that I want to read in the library 's collection .
I use the mail reservation and delivery service .
The book is delivered at a convenience store near my house by the library,

Foe example , while surfing on the Internet , I ordered something .
( assume it was a teddy bear ) .
Let 's assume here that it was a teddy bear .
So I wanted to call them .
If I say , " Hello my name is ... .

Hahaha.. .
So I made my own English expression : " Hello .
So I made up my own English phrases : " Hello .
When I ask someone about this , everyone says
When I asked others about my phrasing/wording , they all said,
" Natives seldom say'As for... ' in like cases like these. " [ Nope , we do n't. ]
Is there no expression like this ? [ Not used in the same way. In English , we 'd normally set the topic with a full cluse. " I ordered a teddy bear two weeks ago. " That sets the topic like に つ い て in Japanese. Then we 'd say " But I have n't heard anything about it since then. " ]
Please help me if possible .
How should we handle this ?
Sorry for my broken English !
The earthquake forecast ,2011,3,14 .
Please laugh at me and call me a fool .
I made a conclusion about the relation between the earthquake and planet location .
last year I wrote an entry about ( I may have deleted it. ) the statistics of potential global energy .
I researched the connection but I could n't find
the exact frequency between figures and earthquake .
I researched this for a while , but because of this one exception I was unable to find the connection .
last year I wondered if the big earthquake happened within
the highest and lowest numbers I gathered .
But even now , I can not fully place my trust in these statistics .
But the Big earthquake in 2010 , and the one in Kobe and so on happened to occur within one month of each other .
I have already researched it .
Although it may be long ,the following is my conclusion .
① When universal global potential energy was around its highest or lowest ,the earthquake energy may have a tendency to increase .
② The seabed fault ( = slit ) ,which is vertical against mass circulation , moves ( this is an assumption ) .
③ Some patterns occasionally arise within the dates , but it is too difficult to find an exact correlation .
※ ② is still suspicious
※ About ① , a few exceptions could not be found through this method .
Please put your own thoughts into this as well .
Thank you for reading this .
500 ~ 600km away , urban location here in Tokyo , that was not the earthquake. An innumerable amount of worms went underground and traveled from south to north. ( I had difficulty understanding this part )

Why do they not say , " Do is doe ,a female deer. " as the sentence in English ?
Are these the clauses of the sentence ? I am not sure .
Or shortened expression , as which I should think ? - I think the parts like " Do a deer , a female deer. , " is a short expression. Same with the others .

Waiting for him is what she hates the most .
She looks again at the old clock .
The silence is surrounding her , and she ca n't help trembling while she thinks about him .
The living room is cold , so is she .
Her voice is a whisper that disappears into the living room like a dream does when the night is over .
She ca n't stand it anymore and turns on the tv , and her eyes become fixed on the screen .
Breathless , she finally arrives there to find him taking his shoes off and she 's unable to control herself and holds him so tightly that he ca n't breathe .
Smiling , the boy kisses her head and pulls her away softy " It 's late , you should be sleeping , not waiting for me " he says tenderly " You know I wo n't be sleeping until here you 're here. " Narrowing his eyes , the boy walks through the corridor until he realizes the TV is still on .
In silence , he crosses the door and his eyes glued on the screen .
There , he holds her tightly making her smile .
" Now that you 're here I can sleep "
I 'm alive .
I 'm alive .
Haha .
I 'm hardly ever active on here , but I always check my inbox , messages , and watch all the new submissions .
I do n't like this place , it is so different from the blogs that I have used before and it ca n't be open under other browsers except IE .
All I feel here is sadness and nostalgia .
However , I 'm sure I 'll upload stuff , and try to comment .
All I do is stalk and + fav these days .
I am an extremely positive soul now. A lot has changed , a lot has happened , a lot has made me realize where I 'd been going wrong with for a very long time .
I feel my life is a lot more fulfilling and just generally better .
I love growing and learning , there is no better feeling then being able to look at yourself , at how you were , and how you are now , and see the positive changes you are able to implement upon yourself through time and experience .
No matter how society changes , there are things which have n't changed through times ; the sense of following rules , morality , public spiritness , consideration towards others , the upholding of human rights , the awe in things which have powers beyond human-beings and the love for our hometown 's nature and culture .
Education is being needed to foster these social characters and enrich human minds according to each of the children development stages .

Well , I 'm not a good speaker in either English or Japanese. ( You use either in negative sentences and both in positive sentences ) .
At the moment , I have forgotten what a real conversation is like .

We went to one of my favourite restaurants in Sannomiya where we ate Gyoza and Chinese dumpling .

During my class , my students had to give their presentations .

This class has 4 teachers including myself .
So my role is kind of easy .
I usually help them with their computers .
So I do n't usually use English in this class , which was kind of relief for me .
After they finished thier presentations , the other teachers started giving comments and feedback about their presentations .
I did n't expect that I would have to give comments in front of them .
I did n't expect that I have to comment as well .
So when the other teacher asked me to give comments suddenly , I got so nervous
Ah , I enjoyed it very much'
I regret that I could n't speak English freely and give longer , more decent and appropriate comments .

① Although it 's gradual , various trials which seek out a reform of education have begun in schools of each area .
If the ideas or devices of teachers and lecturers accord with the expectations from children and parents , these trials might have good effects .
At first , I suggest it is important to let children study what to learn , how to think and how to express themselves .
Looking back on the last 30 years , I can not help but be surprised at the intensive changes of the suburbs of Tokyo .
You can not see the reminiscence of old fields unless you go far from the center of the city .
For our country , it 's extremely important to increase mutual understanding between nations through international exchange and advertising activities in each field and it is also important to build friendly relationships based on mutual trust .
I was n't able to do my best as I was so nervous and this was partly because I realized that I was not so serious. .
I was n't able to do my best as I was so nervous. This is partly because I realized that I am not so serious. .
The reason why I said I was n't serious about taking tests is that I did n't have a specific goal for my future .
It 's kinda like , I felt I have been forced to do everything .
It 's been a big problem for me for a long time .
Today when I was studying English , I realized that I was n't eligible to become a teacher because I am not good at conversation .
I think I 'm not qualified to become a teacher unless I enjoy conversation .
If you do n't have communication skill , you should n't be teaching .
As I came to the above conclusion this afternoon , I went to a church where I hang out a lot .
There I decided to talk about what I have in mind more positively .
Next time , I 'm going to talk to a person who I am attracted to .
There are some troublesome things for foreigners who are going to live in Japan , one of which is trouble ( in understanding things ) due to not being good at Japanese .
It is difficult for them to deal with things like putting out garbage where there are different rules for each area , and being able to communicate well with neighbors .
Today in Kobe city , we have an annual big event , the Fireworks Festival ! !
So I am going to wear a yukata , which is traditional Japanese clothing for wearing in summertime .
We need to be able to train people to state their own opinions confidently in English to foreigners ,and to explain and convince others about circumstances peculiar to Japan .
Even if a teacher has a higher skill of teaching , it might often not do well if there is no connection between a teacher and a students ' mind .
In order for that , teacher 's skillful questions and feedback are to be welcomed by children. Mutual trust must be needed as a first step .
Family plays a very important role in the sound growth of juveniles. → A family plays a very important role in fostering the mind of youngsters .
Parents centered family , members of which help each other , helps to foster a considerate mind towards family in child 's heart. → A family , whose member cooperate with each other well , is good for developing a mind with sympathy toward family .
According to my experience , there is very little chance that something you saved , thinking it would be useful afterwards , is actually useful .
The reason why we make tidy something up is because we may want to reuse it afterwards .
When you actually make the effort to thrown something out , it is a very refreshing feeling .

As I wrote in my last diary , the students are so nice .
Some are so cute that I would like to go out with them if it was not illegal .
I am so nervous that I ca n't speak English well , even I ca n't speak Japanese very well .
Though I am getting used to standing and teaching in front of them. Still it 's embarrasing and I feel nervous .
I really want to get to know and make a good relationship with them .
However , I feel so isolated that I ca n't open my heart nor relax myself .
I know I should interact with ALTs and improve my English , but I 'm so tired that I am not able to communicate smoothly .
So I have decided to wake up earlier and do some exercises .
It is said that doing some exercise in the morning will make us heathier .

Long Time No See
It 's been a long time since I last wrote my diary .
I think I use the same phrase all the time whenever I start my diary .
Well , I will talk about recent happenings in my life .
I 've just begun teaching in high school .
I am having fun in school ! !
Students are so nice and obedient , which is very good for me since I am a beginner .
But things are n't always good .
First , students are very very good at English because this school is well known for its high-standard English education .
So it 's hard for me to teach them as some of them are even better than I am .
There are some students who grew up abroad .
In terms of speaking , I feel inferior to them .
Today , my cold is worse because I helped my senior till late yesterday .
I helped edit a video celebrating my senior 's friends getting .wedding
So my condition is bad since noon when I went to work .
I was sleeping till I want back home this afternoon .

Looking back in the past , he realized that his

Please , let me know .
Thank you very much for your time .
Because , I have a test for my university .
Today , I have a test and I went to a department store to look for a diary for 2010 .
I found two good diary designs .
One is a smiling girl lying down on the grass , the other is a cute girl kissing a puppy .
I would like to brush up on my english skill .
Which do you think is better : writing my diary or other topics ?
today , I studied French and English because I have a test next week .
I am having a tough time : (
Firstly , I think we need sports , because if you do n't move your body or exercise,you 'll turn fat or unfit and it will harm your health .
Secondly,we need reflesh times. ( I do n't understand what you mean by reflesh ) maybe you could try this -- > 1 ) Another reason is , sports take away stress. 2 ) secondly , we need to relax .
I think if we ... 1 ) do n't have stress 2 ) relax ... we could study happily
I am a beginner and there is a little that I can do .
1- Initial version of this photo .
2- Blue eyes ( not very good ) .
3- Fantastic eyes .
Year of Youth - for the development of any country is a very significant part of its history .
Year of Youth - for the development of any country is very significant part of it 's history .
From that what is now growing youth , depends on the future of the country .
Can not limit us , otherwise the entire interest in all things is lost. -- > We should not be limited,
There is no incentive to do everything possible for the ( ? ) country .
I am an excellent student , studying in the 9th grade .
Our class is like a small state , but in it , so small , there are misunderstandings and quarrels , which undermine our activities and friendship .
Teachers help us learn school material - but it depends on our performance .
Government , as the most important thing in our country , should pay attention to all professions , not just the the ones that will benefit them .
Only then will young people will be a great choice and great potential to reveal their secret talents .
This year in Russia was a year of youth and our Russian teacher gave us the job for the summer , to write an essay on the theme " Year of Youth "
I apologize for my mistakes , I hope you were interested to read my essay. -- > I hope it was interesting to read / I hope you were interested in reading my essay .
Whenever I see the cat , my eyes feel itchy .
A short time laterI ca n't stop having a runny nosefor a while .
I already knew that I am allergic to cats .
Does anyone know a medical treatment forcat allergies ?
My book club meets today .
The club meets once a month and has 10 members .
Today we will discuss the book " Me 2.0 " written by Dan Schawbel .
I am a group facilitator .
My purpose in today 's meeting is to help others express their opinions rather than to give my own opinions .
Has anyone read this book ?
I am so upset now that I do n't know what I should do next. ( If you use " should " here , it sounds more native )
How can I find ( the ) time to repair my computer in these very busy days ? ( or you can say ... " in such busy days ? " )
I find that I 'm a very unlucky man , I often buy electronic products that go bad soon. ( This sounds smoother. )
I 'm ( so ) mad about it. ( or " It makes me ( so ) mad. " )
How can there be a Lantern Festival ?
I ca n't be be there with with my family .
I live around Osaka airport with my husband .
I had been studying English at a school before , but my teacher has gone back to his country
so I was looking for some place where I can learn it .
My friend succeeded at losing 10kg a year. ( " 10kg a year " is another way to say " 10kg per year " or " 10kg every year. " You probably wanted to say either " this year " or " last year. " )
She has only a small portion of rice at dinner and has been running 30min at a time .
I said I ca n't do that for my diet , I do n't like running. ( another possibility is " I ca n't do it that way... " )
She said it 's okay as long as you are running , even if it 's slow .
I 'm going to start it again , there is a nice river near my apartment .
Now I try to only have tea instead of Coke when I can get a free drink. ( Also fine : " Now I try just having some tea... " )
I ask the waiter and have only half of the normal amount of rice at restaurants , and a small portion of rice at dinner. ( " half of the rice at the restaurant " is pretty understandable , but could be interpreted as " ( half of ) ( the rice at the restaurant ) , " which is a lot of rice ! )
The website ( what website ? It sounds odd to say 'the website ' with nothing introducing it ) defines " paternalism " as the following :
Moreover , according to " Guide to Cross Cultural Communication " which is written by Sana Reynolds and Deborah Valentine , there are two characteristics in " paternalism. " paternalism has two characteristics.What you wrote is n't wrong , but this way sounds more natural to me. Also , you do n't need to put paternalism in quotes every time .
First , people who are more powerful control less powerful people. or , " people who have more power control people with less power "
Second , people who have the right to control less powerful people must take care of them. I 'm just guessing that this is what you wanted to say , because " take of them " does n't make sense .
I have defined " paternalism " up to now. This is essentially what " paternalism " is. Saying that you have defined it after such a short time when you said you would define it at the beginning sounds repetitive. You could also say , if you wanted to sound a bit more official , " This is essentially what constitutes 'paternalism'. "
Henceforth , I would like to write about a social issue in Japanese society in which I think " paternalism " is can be observed. If you say " is observed " it makes it sound like everyone is studying it very intently , as though they are worried about it , which I do n't think is what you intended .
I think " paternalism " is can still be observed in medicine. I 'm a little confused as to why you have " still " here , as it implies that paternalism is dying out. Since there is no mention of this , it sounds a bit odd ? If that 's what you intended , then it 's fine .
This is because the doctor has confidence in his ability. Since this is a general statement , it sounds very strange to use " my. " Whose ability are we talking about ? The doctor 's ?
Certainly , the doctor 's decision is sometimes right , but there are a few chances to misunderstand the condition of the patient. ways in which the patient 's condition can be misunderstood. " chances " makes it sound like the doctor is trying to misunderstand. I ca n't think of a better word in place of " chance , " so if I were to say this I 'd put it into the passive as such .

I love Scandinavian furniture .
These days , I am into Scandinavian furniture .
I love that they are sophisticated , cute and simply designed and that they do not get old quickly. I can also feel the warmth of the wood from them .
Many antique Scandinavian pieces of furniture are made with rosewood , mahogany or teak wood , so they have different auras to contemporary wooden furniture .
The colors of the wood is in between oak and walnut , which are popular woods in contemporary furniture .
Recently rosewood and teak are hard to find , so there are many funs for antique furniture. ( I 'm not quite sure what you 're trying to say by 'many funs'. )

This bamboo flute would be my grandfather 's father 's -and I received to it as an inheritance .
Today I am going to a repair shop to ask if this bamboo flute can be repaired .
Yesterday found me discussing the history and customs of the bamboo flute with a craftsman and teacher of bamboo flute , until twilight .
The following is a little part of our conversation .
" The bamboo flute is not as difficult as you might have thought. "
" It 's fascinating. About 600 people practice it in California , according to my pupil who teaches there. "
" I 'm involved in the Revival of the Orthodox Bamboo Flute in China. "
Our conversation continued in this manner , until we noticed twilight was coming. It was pretty informative/interesting/constructive !

I always think that keeping an English diary is a good way to practice my English skills .
But , unfortunately , I somehow did n't do it .
Therefore , I chose to join Lang-8 !
But my English did not improve.First , one thing that I felt was that I am not afraid of English anymore even thought I could not ( could not what ? ) what people said .
But even though my English h [ /BLUE ] as not improved , one thing that I have felt is that I am not afraid of using English any more , even though I could not understand what people said .
In other words , I do not care about the people around me .
I do n't know if it is good or bad .
I do n't know if that is good or bad .
I am still eagerly wishing that I could use English like a native .
I hope I will have a good weekend , and so will all of you !
As foreign people may know , there are a lot of situations to use the Microsoft Power Point in presentations .
The revolutionary software has been very useful to display information effectively and provocatively to the audience .
The revolutionary software has been very useful in presenting information effectively and provocatively to the audience .
I often use the application conveniently , although , I have a big problem with using the software when translating Japanese material into English .
I often translate Power Point documents in Japanese to English .
Mistakes in a translation are n't much of a problem because it 's checked by a senior of mine at the end of the translation .
Kanji shows a lot of meaning by itself .
Each kanji gives a lot of information to a word .
Speaking of an example which I encountered today , I dealt with " 法 令 対 応 範 囲 . " ( 6 words ) It means " scope for the enforcement by Japanese law. " But if I try to enter the phrase in small box on a sheet of a Power Point document , the phrase can be entered with only small fonts which would n't be seen by remote audience when having a presentation .
As an example , today I dealt with " 法 令 対 応 範 囲 . " ( 6 words ) It means " scope for the enforcement of Japanese law.

So how to fit a small space bothers me every time I translate Japanese into English .

As you may know , the Japanese calender hasa " Golden week , " which is a combination of national holidays in early May .
But I do n't like this system where the government places many national holidays at the same time and makes consecutive holidays .
Since everybody gets off at the same time , almost all of places where people go--such as amusement parks , zoos , theaters , and the roads people will get there on-- will be hardly ( ま た は " heavily " ? ) crowded .
Although the Japanese labor system has the same system of " holidays with pay " applied to many foreign countries which everyone can take at will , willing Japanese workers do n't get that supposedly because the Japanese are assiduous and do n't want to act alone , such as getting a holiday with pay while other co-workers work .
I think this is so inefficient that we should decrease national holidays and make getting a certain number of holidays with pay obligatory .
It 's the center of the Golden week right now , but despite that , I 'm working at my office as usual !
This is the first diary I 've written on this site .
I stayed in London , UK last year for two months in order to study English .

Cherry Blossoms in Japan
I do n't think there could be a single Japanese person who dislikes cherry blossoms .
As you can see in the pictures above , in this season we have picnic parties under the cherry trees while watching the blossoms opening up or flying down from the trees .
One week ago , I went to a park with my wife and daughter to that was 30 minutes by car from my home .
One week ago , I also went to a park with my wife and daughter to a park that was 30 minutes by car from my home .
I was very happy to see the blossoms just starting to fall off from the branches , as if the cherry blossoms are April showers .
Japanese people are especially fascinated by falling cherry blossoms .
Medieval Japanese fighter 'Bushi ' hoped to die with dignity and beauty in battle , like falling cherry blossoms .
Medieval Japanese fighters called 'Bushi ' hoped to die during battles with dignity and beauty like falling cherry blossoms .
Of course , we do n't take it to that extreme , but I think the love for the 'cherry blossom ' is a precious culture that 's passed down through the generations in Japan .

Do you know what the captioned phrase means ?
As it may be known only in Japan , I will tell you. It 's a national campaign against increasing CO2 emission levels .
If you want to know more information about it , please read the following site .
thorough the recycling of wastes generated during our business operation
Although I think I 'm proud of our company 's actions and also individually try to do them voluntarily , recently our office has been so hot that I ca n't get out of my paper fan , which is called " 団 扇 " in Japanese and harness only my own power , due to a energy cut for artificial cooling systems .
Sometimes the hotness make me think that we reduce our working efficiency by 6 % while we reduce of CO2 emission by 6 % !
I 'm writing a notification which informs managers of our subsidiary companies of the schedule for submitting documents to our office .
To begin with , I wrote a Japanese version and now I 'm trying to translate it into English .
But I think it 's difficult due to the ambiguity of Japanese .
As you may know , English word order is very strict and subjects in English play very important roles , which are not usually omitted , I think. Rolls means something different. They are normally something you would eat : - )
I was often told by my co-worker who is good at writting English that foreign people would n't be able to understand my text when I asked him to scan through it after translating it from Japanese to English. Some punctuation would help make this sentence easier to read and understand .

i went around the city for shopping on boxing day .
i bought a bag , some cosmetics , and some clothes etc. .
Of the few birthday gifts I have received they were rather typical gifts .
Maybe , the people who gave them did so with no particular special meaning in those presents .
However , I think whether a present is special or not depends on your own mind rather than the other person 's intent .
In contrast to other gifts , it was the most simple and cheapest one , but it was also my favorite one .
It was different from those pencil boxes you can see in the bookstore , it was not made of textile but plastic .
Compared to those with a colorful and delicate design it is a simple white-black matching color and square shape .
My friends usually praise my box for its cute pattern which is different from those monotonous logos on other pencil boxes .
What a delight for me is that everybody likes the pencil box so mush and wants to buy a similar one for themselves .
Nevertheless , the reason why I like the present so much is not the pattern , the color or the shape , but the memory of the friend who gave the gift .
What touched me deeply was that my classmate carved some words with best wishes in the pencil box for me .
Come on , come on..... .
English is very difficult for me .

It looks like not only me , but also other people all around the world are interested in the Android phone .
The reason that the Android phone is popular is that it is made by Google and it is a rival ( or : competitor ) to the iPhone .
I do n't have an iPhone but I do have an iPod with similar functions. ( an iPod Touch I presume ? )
Then recently I bought the Android development tool-kit ( or : SDK ) .
I want to make my own applications to study ( even ) harder .
I have used iPod touch ever since a year ago,
so my iPod silicon cover got worn-out .
Yesterday , I bought a new iPod cover .
It 's made by Belkin. ( From is used to indicate that something is coming from somewhere. From USA to Korea. But if something is made in a company like Belkin , you write : It is made by Belkin. )
Belkin is a known computer accessory company. ( Famous is n't really natural in this context , however Belkin is a known company. )
It 's most expansive among the other products .
The Belkin cover is/costs 29 dollars , while the others are around 9 dollar .
But even so I bought it,
because I like the design and it feels good in the hand .
It 's a very good cover , except price .

Today my girlfriend and I went to the department store
because she wanted to buy a bag .
All of the bags ' prices were very , very expensive , though .

so we looked around at more shops for a long time
untilshe finally ended up buying nothing at all .
Shopping with a woman is truly a hard thing for a man .

Perhaps an Ipad is useless for me .
However , I just want to buy it .

Can someone edit / correct this ?
The Russo-Japanese War began / started because Japan wanted to halt the spread of the Russian expansion into East Asia .
This was what Japan feared the most , since they regarded Korea and Manchuria as a buffer .
If an agreement was not made soon , war would break out at once , which worried all of Europe since / as Russia was allied with France and Germany , and Japan had ( already ) signed a treaty with Great Britain .
Europe was concerned that the war would spread across the world .
It 's not that anyone sought war in either country ( Russia and Japan ) , but no matter what happened , it 's as if the war was supposed to happen. / ...but despite everything , war was inevitable .
However , we only arrived to these circumstances due to outdated governmental policies by almost half a century .
The following will explain in detail the events of the Russo-Japanese war and how Japan was conceived as an " easy " enemy , yet who came to be acknowledged as one of the greatest military powers in the world after the apparent victory during the Battle of the Sea of Japan .
My boyfriend was a hot-tempered person , but he improved himself in order to stay with me .
Yesterday , we discussed a book called " Stuffed and Starved : Market , Power and the Hidden Battle for the World Food System. "
When I started talking louder and emotionally unconsciously , he was quiet and gazed at me with a smile .
I saw the change in his expression , so I realized that my talking attitude had was too impatient .
" Did I do something wrong ? " I asked .
" No , I think you were angry when we talked about the poor farmers , due to the fact that you are kindhearted. " [ Wretched is more common for something you hate... you could say that if you hated those farmers but that would be really mean ! ]
I feel he is gentle unlike before , and I am deeply touched by him .
My friends usually call me by my Chinese nickname " 白 , " which means " white. "

My interest grew stronger as your company has now launched Russian servers and is hiring Russian-speaking employees .
Your decision to launch Russian servers and hire Russian-speaking employees sharpened my interest .
I was impressed that hiring was part of the launch process and not left until post-launch .
I have broad experience both working with a team and and dealing directly with the public. I found my employment at Autotrade AG particularly valuable in developing these skills : While there , I provided information to and satisfied the needs of a particularly diverse group of customers .
Being a part of Staff Empire recruitment agency has taught developed my ability to work under pressure ( is this " mode " ok ?
As a part of Staff Empire Recruiting Agency [ use whatever the full title is ] , I handle the needs of both employers and candidates in a high pressure , time sensitive environment .

I would be available for foreign travel from the beginning of June and I am available for interview at any time after that .
I am available by phone at any time and would be able to travel for a face to face interview from the beginning of June onward .
Yours sincerely,
This is my very first post here .
I have no idea what language I should use for my Journal. My French is still very poor , so everything I can only say things like " je m'apelle " or " j'habite " etc .
I really need to find the right motivation to use French only .
So , dear friends , please consider this my " English entry. "
That is , if you can call this year 's abnormal spring " nice " . ( 'Abnormal ' is an odd choice of phrase here , but its not wrong per se... )
My favorite weather site promises that we 'll have a real summer this week , but we 'll see , we 'll see .
Tomorrow I hope to complete one piece of business I really need to finish. ( Alternatively : Tomorrow I hope to succeed in finishing some business that really needs doing .
Finally I have all my documents for my " abroad-passport. " ( Papers and documents are the same thing , or close enough. And in English it is just called a 'passport ' as we do n't have internal passports : ) )
I really do n't know what to call it in English since there 's no such term in the rest of the world !
And here in Russia its still like in the USSR : one passport for this country , another one for travelling abroad .
Its/It is Really stupid. ( You do n't actually need the 'its ' , but it is better grammatically. )
Although I do n't know if I will be able to use my new passport any time soon , as I do n't have the spare money for any kind of long-distance trips and the situation with my vacation time is still unclear .
Whatever , at least I will have the chance to travel. Or : at least now I will be able to travel !
To know that I can go anywhere if I really need to,
somehow makes me feel better .
A couple of years ago I was a very " international " girl. I had pen pals from many countries. It was fun and interesting .
After that I created an account at LiveJournal and became part of the Russian community there .
And now I 've lost contact with everybody I was in touch with from my " international " life .
Really miss it .
Further more , I started using the Internet in 1999. and I started it from international part. ( I 'm not sure what you mean here )
And the truth is that the Internet was the main thing that made me start SPEAKING English. I , who was learning it in my early school years but could n't say a word .
The main mistake of our schools here in teaching languages is that all foreign languages are taught as a static subject .
As a subject that no one can relate to .
It 's pretty simple to understand that languages are instruments of communication .
So I believe that this Lang-8 space will bring back my " International " side
Of course , I can post more or less personal blahblah things here , but I 'd love to be more useful to the rest of community .
For example... For those ones who are studying Russian or just interested in what 's going on in Russia :
I can do small things. I can write small articles about Russian related subjects that you 'd love to know about . Or maybe I can take pictures of special places/things etc .
Any ideas/wishes ?
I will forget him
The afternnoon is very quiet , I can only hear the voices of beating the keyboard. ( This sounds very poetic so I hesitate to change it lest I change the feeling you were trying to portray. You might say something like , " The afternoon is very quiet , I can only hear the voices of tapped keys on a keyboard , " I 'm not sure I captured your meaning correctly )
The afternoon is very quiet,I can only hear the sound of typing keyboard .
I do n't know what I 'm thinking now .
I do n't know what am I thinking now. ( You always use this word order when using a question with WHAT. )
Spring Festival is coming soon , so I hope I can forget him and this love...... .
Spring Festival is coming up soon. I hope I can forget him and this love... ( Maybe it would be better " our love " ? But it depends on the context. )
Some people think it 's too difficult to say , so they call me Evy. [ Or : '...difficult to pronounce ' ]
I study at university and major in Bioenvironmental System engineering. [ It sounds weird , but most people would say 'I study at university. ' ]
I did n't understand the profession lesson clearly since I have just finished the part of freshmen. [ Do you mean to say you just finished your first year ? ]
Though I 've studied English since elementary [ school ] , it is still very poor now. [ A more natural and casual way of saying the last part would be , '...I 'm still not very good at it. ' ]
I want to use this site to practice writing and keep a diary .
To tell the truth , I do n't what my dream is .
When I was in senior high school , the only thing I wanted to achieve is to study at the National Taiwan University .
It 's a very shortsighted dream right ?
But I really enjoy the times when I play the piano and learn English .
If these subjects are included in my plan for the next few years , going aboard for an international study program is what I want to do .
And I should improve my skill at playing the piano so that I can pass the music examination .
Maybe I will understand something on the way towards my dream .
I join a lot of activities , search for a lot of information from everywhere , read different books including periodicals and magazines to find my life 's direction .
S Since I am not writing competitively for a real exam , I do n't want to write down the naive dream like I did before .

that means that a lazy guy is sitting on the sofa eating potatoes,

Now , I 'm preparing for my one year study in America as an international student .
I am trying my best to sharpen all my abilities to make progress in my English learning .

I got up at 6 : 00 a.m. It was early for me , !
In the morning , Ayami and me walked around in Makuhari messe .
The photo above , taken from the first picture was Sonic stage .
As you can see , No one is in the photo xD
It took us about one and a half hour !
I had this towel on me in my profile picture .
Awaited time had come at last .
We went to the front spot nearby and sang together .
It was very ! ! exciting
A person from abroad ashore behind us and he was singing as well .
When Gerard sang a Cancer ( not too sure what you are trying to tell... ) , he came to the centar ( center ? ) of the audience ! ( ° Д ° ) We were very surprised ! !
It was like we dived into the sea .
But the occasion/event excited us .
We listened to the new songs , and we saw the fireworks !
I will never ever forget this memories .
, when it had come to an end , we were waiting for a train , a person from abroad asked us for the schedule .
Ayami answered quickly
I should have study harder .
I deeply regret that sometimes I could n't understand what Gerard says .
I promised to go to the next summer sonic ( what is summer sonic ? v ^ _ ^ v , language school ? ) and go abroad with Ayami .
It seems that we will be having a small athletic meeting again in October .
I sawa rainbow appeared on my way home from the school .
So I went shopping by bicycle .
Was it a bad day or a good day ?
Yesterday , we had the last class with our ALT. ( I 'm guessing ALT is a language teacher ? )
Our ALT is leaving our high school this summer vacation .
He showed us this site .
Thank you very much for teaching us for three years .
I 'm going to study English hard and go abroad !
Basketball and volleyball are very exciting ! !
Many boys look cool in the athletic meet every year .
I bought two nail polishes and a tank top .
The nail polishes were 100 yen each , and the tank top was 500 yen. ( I 'm just making some assumptions here , forgive me if they 're wrong ! )
I am tired but I enjoyed today .
I 've just dropped my plate and broken it. ( It 's more natural to say " I just dropped my plate and broke it. " )
I think I 'm a really careless mother .
I think I 've broken these/those plates once a month... ( " once a month " implies once every month. Alternatively , you can say " I think I 've broken one of these plates every month. )
Usually , how often does this sort of thing happen to you ?
Starting Lang-8 for studying english
When I was a university student , I studied English .
But I have not used it since then .
two days ago , I told my boss that I want to go to working abroad .
The day before yesterday , I told my boss that I want to work abroad .
I should improve my English , thus .
Please correct my sentences and let 's be friends .
Today I played Mario Kart Wii with my child. ( this is fine , but saying son/daughter sounds more natural )
He is 2years old , so he just held the controller .
But he felt that playing the game. < --Seems to be missing a word describing emotion after 'felt'. Maybe you meant 'But he felt happy while playing the game.'
He likes it very much,often invited me.He liked it very much , he even asks me to play with him now .
In Korea , criminals are on the rise each day .
A reason for this problem is that an increasing number of young people are becoming criminals .
If our country does n't correct laws , it will perish in the near future due to student 's criminal behavior .
I think that the laws must change for our brighten life .
For the benefit of all people , public peace must be keep all day .
today , I have a police test in english. ( is the test actually called " police english test " ? if it is , then it 's okay. )
It is very difficult to slove the problems on the test .
I think that english is a very hard subject,
but , to be a policeman , ( policemen is more than one policeman ) I have to learn the police english. ( connect this sentence with the sentence above. )
so , i will study english steadily from now on. ( OR i will study english often. )
Maybe it 's too late to talk about this year 's Valentine 's , as the day has already passed .
But there are some interesting things that I 'd like to take note of .
On that day , I gave a phone call to my parents to wish them a Happy Valentine 's Day .
My mom mentioned that she had not received any gifts from my dad .
My Daddy is one of those traditional Chinese men .
He loves my mom very much , but rarely , if ever , says " I love you " to my mom ; at least , he never says it when I 'm around .
He would rather cook a good dinner than offer useless words and flowers .
This is the same for most of Chinese men of the traditional sort .
Many of whom are middle-aged .
I called dad , said that he could buy a pouch of shrimps and cook them as a gift for mom !
In my local dialect , " shrimp " and " flower " have the same pronunciation , " Hou. "
So this Valentine 's Day , my mom received " Hou " as a gift and she was very happy about it .
My dad was also very happy ; for the " shrimps " not only showed his love for my mom on that special day , but he wasted no money on unnecessary matters too .
I caught a bad cold last week .
At first , my nose was runny and I could not stop sneezing .
Then one night , my nose was totally stuffed up and I could not breath at all !
I did not get much sleep because I could not breathe .
I could not sleep .
When I finally fell asleep , I did not sleep well .
Now I am dizzy and I can not hear well .
When people talk to me , the voices sound like they are coming from 30 miles away .
It feels like a piece of paper is covering my ear .
I hate having a cold .
My nose is still stuffed up as I type these words .
This afternoon , i will take the train to go to Suzhou From Shanghai .
The distance is 84 km from Shanghai to Suzhou , so it will only take me about half an hour with the new High-Speed China Railway .
It is very famous for its ancient private gardens .
Many of them are listed in World Culture Heritage like :
They all have their own characteristics .
I will go and visit these gardens this weekend .
Acturally I visited them several times already .
When I returned back home , I was still thinking of those beautiful and graceful gardens , I even dreamed of them at night .
So I decided to visit them again .
.This time it will be an enjoyable tour .
I am so happy to hear that one of my best friends will be getting married this October !
She said all the wedding preparation will be done by her and her fiance .
Because in China , most parents will undertake almost all wedding preparations instead of their children .
Now my friend has 8 months to prepare until October .
So they will have a very beautiful wedding photo associate with good landscape .
My friend also said that she will go buy her wedding dress after the May Day Holiday .
Because in China , MDH is a big holiday and almost every employee will have a 3-7 paid-holiday , and that means people will have free time to be invited to weddings or other big functions. - > 'issues ' is used in a grave context when compared to 'functions'
So many couples will choose MDH to celebrate their weddings .
That will cause the price inflation of merchandise .
And after the MDH , the prices will reduce to normal .
I hope she can find her own style !
And I wish good luck to my friend .
This is my first entry on Lang-8 .
I heard of this website from one of my friends .
I think this website will be very helpful for my English learning .
I have been learning English for several years .
I used to use it at work .
But I have not used it in nearly one ( or " a " instead of " one " ) year because I quit that job. ( I 'm not sure what you meant by " pre-job. " )
I am not familiar with writing in English anymore , but now I have decided to hunt for a new job in a foreign company , which will require me to have d very good English skills .
So I have decided to practice my English writing skills from now on , on here , Lang-8 .
I hope my English Skills will improve step by step ( or , " bit by bit " ) .
Then one night , i felt my nose was totally stopping up , I could not breathe at all !
I had very bad sleep ( or I slept badly ) these past days because of the nose problem .
I can not get to sleep .
Even when I at last got to sleep , my sleep was not deep , and I awoke easily .
When people talk to me , the voice sounds like it is 30 miles away from me .
It sounds like a piece of paper is covering my ear .
I hate to have cold. ( or I hate having a cold )
My nose is still stopping up as I type these words .
Can you imagine what a cute old man he is , wearing a pink kimono , pink wig and also holding some lovely dolls .
I thought he was a young lady when I just saw him from behind .
Today I saw him again in the subway .
But he was a little different from before , because this time he was wearing a green wig .
There were so many people staring at him .
And the most unbelievable thing was that he did n't seem afraid , but rather excited .
My English is so poor that l want to brush it up , and I want to make friends .
I like watching movies and traveling in many places .
I need to use this article in class the day after tomorrow ! ! ! Thank you very much !

There are many , many theses.. .
So , I decided to divide the theses list by years .
* the fiscal year 2010
* the fiscal year 2009
* the fiscal year 2008
But , I understand that " fiscal " indicates a financial sense .
The financial year is from October 1 to September 30 .
I need a word like the word 'fiscal ' which means the term from April 1 to March 31 .
What words should I write instead of the phrase " the fiscal year in XXXX " ?

This is my new band , Final Liberty , and I ( just ) uploaded my our song 'Evil Braze' .
The song is sung in Japanese , and I did the growling .
I love guitar players influenced by Van Halen , this guy is very good at making melody lines .
If you watch samurai X that is called rurouni kenshin in Japan , you may have listened to their song called pure feeling that is one third. ( I do n't know what you mean by " one third. " )
They made want to make songs like Van Halen first .
I like hard rock songs more than heavy metal maybe , but sometimes I want to listen to Manowar and Judas Priest .

My dream is to make theme songs for Japanese hentai games .
When you think of hentai games , you 'll have a negative image maybe .
But these games have great stories and melodious songs .
For example , this is the theme song of Air .
It has great lyrics and a great melody , do n't you think so ?
If songs I made were listened to by anime fans and game fans , that would be great and this is my goal of my life .
I respect the people who made these songs .
My purpose in starting Lang-8 is to meet a lot of game fans and anime fans abroad .
I want to make hentai games in the future and make theme songs by myself .
But my wish is stronger than others .
I made this video for youtube and nikoniko movies , check it out ! ! ! ! ( sounds more natural )

Presenting Abstract Thoughts in English
In Japan we are forced to be like others from when we are born .
In elementary school , we are taught to conform with people in our class .
In elementary school , we are taught to protect conformity amongst the people in our class .
For example , when an athletic meet is held , we are forced to march like soldiers in north korea .
And if you make a mistake in such a situation , you are scolded by teachers .
Not just in school , but also amongst your friends , when we go to 'KARAOKE ' you must sing songs your friends know .
Conformity is not just practiced in school , it also practiced amongst friends. In public , it is expected that we sing songs that our friends know when we go to karaoke .
If you sing metal songs , you are looked upon coldly by your friends .
So if you were in Japan , you should make sure to conform with others .
So if you are in Japan , you should take care to conform with others .
I must get up early tomorrow in order to play basketball at my university 's gym .
I sent an e-mail to my senior to play with me , but he wo n't come for when we have promised .
If he is late tomorrow , I will practice shooting whilst waiting for him .
While I was waiting for a customer , I was reading the book that my professor lent me .
Compared to my previous job , my job now is easy and interesting .
I think that there is nothing as easy a part-time job as mine .
Until 8th February , I have no days off .
I am tired from my business routine and of life .
Although I really need holidays to travel around the world , going-on depression would n't admit me any holidays .
I hope , you enjoy this scary video too .
We , all the businesspeople , just behave like them : dog , boy , laser pointer or cameraman .

Did you determine in which shop to buy a Christmas cake ?
A Japanese restaurant has developed a new type of cake that nobody has ever seen .
They could receive your advance order. ( sounds okay , but I think , " They could receive your order in advance. " sounds more natural. )
First of all , check the photo , and have a look at the jeweled cake on their site .
It is a must buy !
Unless , as my home-doctor mentioned , " you need to refrain from eating raw fish like sashimi,... "
Fox or Dog ?
I attached 3 cute photos of animals
Here are three cute photos .
Which photos are of a fox and which are of a dog ?
Can you tell which are foxes and which are dogs ?
Recently , I 've read some articles that foreigners can not distinguish between a Japanese dog and a fox .
A couple days ago , I read an article that said foreigners ca n't tell the difference between Japanese Shiba Inu dogs and foxes .
But , now I doubt and guess that those articles are just a kind of AD for the new Hollywood movie : " Hachi. " And , of course , you could tell them apart .
But now , I 'm starting to think it was some kind of marketing ploy for the new ( Hollywood ) movie , " Hachi : A Dog 's Tale. " And of course you could tell which was which .
In this post , I would like to introduce a certain training method of Japanese historical martial arts .

During a preliminary match between Uruguay and Costa Rica , the Costa Rican players started warming up while the Uruguayan players sang their national anthem .
Hearing that , I could n't stop feeling sorry and sad .
Please check the lines of both teams , their expressions , and their eyes .
" Hara-itai " means that something is irritating and annoying .
Contrast to the 30 seconds of footage for Costa Rica .
This pop song was a little bit long before the game .
Costa Rica , I am sincerely sorry .

It has been a long time since I 've written a diary , so I wan na write about some things that happened recently / in the last few days .
First I found a job !
It is so good because I was looking for a job in which I could use my Portuguese skills , and this job is perfect !
To tell the truth , I am not sure that I could do it perfectly , but I will try hard !
Now in Japan it is so hard to find a job , especially for foreigners. I am helping some Brasilian friends but it 's hard.. .
I want this bad time to end > <
I wan na study more to be able to help more people !

necessity of " a " ( it is just a minor spelling error. Those often happen due to similaritys in the pronounciation of 'c ' and 's ' that sometimes occure in english )
It 's a well-known story in Japan , told when you go to another country : ( I had problems guessing your intention in this sentence , so I assumed you wanted to tell , that this story is told to people going to foreign countrys )
A man said to the/a reception clerk , " Could you please call me docter , I 'm feeling sick. " ( You need to add the " to the " or " to a " here , so it is clear that the clerk is the object. Your version might be misread as the man saying the words " reception clerk. " )
Yes , docter. " but even though the man was waiting , a docter did n't come. ( the " however " here is far , far too unclean english. )
A man , catching a cold or something , wanted to get a docter for him. ( I do not remember comma gramatics very well , as I am allready using english like a mothertounge , but I am pretty sure that these two are superfluous. )
I often confuse about a , an , the it needs or not. [ I recommend the following sentence : I often confuse " a " and " an " with each other , and do not know when it is needed , or not.orI am often confused about wether the use of " a " and " an " is nescessary , or not. ]
Wrong articles create misunderstandings .
So I must think of them / remember to use them .
Similarly , Nyankoi is a good anime , and I expect ( instead of " I expect , " you can use " I anticipate , " " I am waiting for , " etc. ) the second season .

I will be careful with this weakness .

This guide is a real cost saver and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to save money on their flights .

So , I went there .
It was small , but a beautiful place !
But there is Starbucks coffee next to it !

So I look forward to going to another cafe with my friend !
Today I learned to write documents in business. ( If you mean you learned to write them in a Business class , capitalize Business. If you mean documents for business , change it to " business documents. " )
It was very difficult to make clear sentences .
I understand I 'm a poor writer .
But today I really felt that Japanese is a difficult language .
I 'd like to be a good Japanese writer as much as I 'd like to be a good English writer , so I must study Japanese , too.. .
See above line .
Today ( December 22 ) is the winter solstice !
In Japan , we take a hot yuzu ( a citrus fruit ) bath on that day. ( Here I would use the native Japanese word , yuzu. You can give the English definition in parentheses. )
Today I was going to take a hot yuzu bath , but I forgot to buy some.. .
So I 'm going to take a normal bath tonight .
Drawing pictures
Watching movies makes me feel like drawing pictures .
As soon as I went to buy sketchbook and pencil .
At first I tried to draw a picture by sight .
I really want to draw while looking my garden but it was cold
When I showed that picture to my grandmother , she said " can you draw a picture of a cow for me , I 'd like to use one for a letter. "
Do you understand why she said that ?
Because they [ we ? ] have a custom to send a letter on January 1st .
We generally write " Happy New Year " and a picture of the twelve signs of the Chinese zodiac in letters .
The picture which I drew is too big so she maybe will scan it with the computer .
I have thought about drawing Peter Rabbit for a long time , so this time I was pleased to draw it .
I 'm sorry I 'm not able to put pictures on this diary .
i am writing a diary entry for the first time .
yesterday i went to an amusement park with my sister .
it takes thirty minutes to get there using freeway .
if i get through the entrance by nine in the morning,it is very cheap .
i left home at eight thirty for that but i had to pay twice the amount of money because we made a mistake in choosing the correct freeway exit .
seeing as we arrived at the amusement park without getting into an accident .
first we enjoyed riding attraction that are selected by Guinness book of world records .
it is the most highest and fastest in the world .
we posed for the camera .
we had good smiles in the photo .
so we wanted to buy the photo but another person was saying.. .
they 're face did n't look good. .
we abandoned buying photo and we promised to buy a photo someday .
after that we took a bath in the spa .
for example hot bath , tepid water .
and the scenes were different .
i relaxed looking at a river , waterfall , and bamboo .
recently Japanese garden instead of increase west garden. ( I 'm not sure what you 're trying to say here... Maybe " Recently , Japanese gardens are increasing in popularity. " But...I 'm not sure if this is what you meant. )
so i think that we have to treasure the Japanese garden .
now my father is studying in Tokyo .
when he comes back , I want to go there again with my family .
we could make good memories .
At first , it seems like drawings , not letters .
So It was difficult even to write each letter
But now , I can read the Hiragana and Katakana and involve in simple conversation .
Basic patterns of Korean letters .
The principles of Korean letters are quite simple ( except several exceptions ) , So if you master the patterns of Korean letters , you 'll be able to read most of the Korean letters .
Listen to Koreans speak as much as you can , and try to pronounce the words like the native speakers .
It 's difficult to pronounce the words naturally if you only by practice the letters .
I think it 'll be helpful to listen to Korean TV programs
Storybooks or fairy tales with tapes or CDs will be easier in the beginning .
Languages arethe combinations of words and some rules
If you master Korean to some basic degree , you can write diaries on this site .
I also write diaries in English these days , and other foreign people 's corrections are really helpful to me .
Type in Chinese or Japanese takes more time and complex .
I heard that the development of Korean IT industry is somewhat affected by the Korean input system. ( it 's one of the reasons why I am thankful for being Korean ) .
The first one is admission .
Students who go this route have to take the GSAT ( General Scholastic Ability Test ) during winter vacation .
If it goes smoothly , you can enter college earlier and have 2 ~ 3 more months of summer vacation .
The second approach is to take the DRT ( Department Required Test ) during the beginning of summer vacation .
Moreover , the DRT always puts focus on the most difficult parts of the courses , so most of the students would rather give up courses of 3rd grade than take the DRT .
They only have to fill in the departments they want to enter on the UAC website 's form , and wait for the result according to their grades .
In other words , the grades determine the outcome
I think that the first way is better because it make schools and parents help students to find their target in life earlier .
High school students in Taiwan must arrive at school 7 : 30 every day , and stay in school for 9 hours until 17 : 00 .
The admission will improve students ' motivation to learn , and it may convince parents to give their children more free time .
I really feel some pressure .
Recently , I am always thinking of the years when i was young,which was happy,relaxing , and there was no pressure .
I 'm looking forward to the future .
It suggests via a picture that China has the dirtiest air condition full of tiny particles all around the country .
This pic was taken just now ( 5 : 30pm ) from my 10-storeyed high apartment 's balcony,Guangzhou City .
The lens is towards west , supposing to capture some sunset scenery but totally vague here and the sun was just missing .
One may think it is foggy but truly it is not the case as the weather is extremely muggy at the moment so you will not feel that easy without an air-conditioner , with a temperature up to 30c and humidity up to 80 % .
Last year I grew tulips and they bloomed very beautifully .
Last week , I ordered tulip bulbs for next spring bloom .
This is the first time for me writing on Lang-8 .
It is the first time for me to write on Lang-8. It is my first time writing on Lang-8 ( This sounds more natural )
I speak like a one or two years old child .
I 'm looking forward to getting replies from people living all over the world .
I 'm looking forward to getting replies from people living somewhere on the world .
We can communicate easily without the distance of speaking different languages .
Making friends with foreigners would be easier .
Secondly , studying English will help us enlarge our knowledge of different fields , such as economics and information technology , which are mostly written about in English .
Thirdly , studying English will make our lives more comfortable .
We will be able to work for international corporations , where English is needed the most .
Moreover , we can get promotions more easily and we can earn a lot of money .
In conclusion , I think English is the key to opening a new life .
Studying English should be taken into more consideration by young people .
Thanks & Best regards
There are two sides to life .
One is happiness , and the other is sadness .
Whenever I receive a client 's disgruntled e-mail , I feel it is a bad day .

I believe there is no place more thirsty for knowledge than my hometown .
There are a lot of people who have no chance to study at a good school , because they are busy spending most of their time earning money for life .
Parents really want their children can go to school like others , but they must deal with the most difficult thing : money .
Their parents really want them to go to school like others , but they must deal with the most difficult thing : money. [ Wolf 's correction is great. I just wanted to add a little to it. ]
Becoming a teacher will not only help me share knowledge with them , but also I love this job very much .
I wish I could establish a small education center. [ Or : I want to establish a small education center. ]
One side , I will teach them how to use the computer , the other side is created job for them by getting works from other companies. ? ? ?
I will teach them how to use computers and help them get hired in other companies .
To make my dream come true , I will try to get familiar job beside the software testing I do now .
Because I work far from my parents , so I can only visit them on holiday .
Because I work far from my parents , I can only visit them on holidays .
Luckily , they were encouraging about opening the center in my hometown .
So I can take care of both of them for all my life .
That 's my dream .
Thanks for your consideration about this journal , looking forward for your correction .
I am studying how to write a business mail .
Is this/the following mail right ?
It is very difficult for me to write a business mail .
I have just decided the schedule of the program .
If you have any questions , please do n't hesitate to send me an e-mail. ( The please is only to make it more polite ) .
Lucy comes to Japan July 22 , 2010
Announcement to the participant ( s ) July 30,2010
Many Japanese take their work very seriously. It is " take " and not " takes " because you 're using a plural subject ( " many Japanese " ) .
But , my husband does not. " But " tends to be more of a conjunctive word used to connect clauses ( eg. Many Japanese take their work very seriously but , my husband does not. ) If you start a new sentence , I suggest " However , my husband does not. "
He sometimes plays truant from ( his ) work ! " Play truant " tends to be used more in the context of a student skipping school. I suggest " He sometimes skips out on his work. "
That/This surprises me .
Should I comfort him ?
This stumps me .
The marathon race will be held two weeks later .
So I need some exercise .
There is a yoga pose which requires standing on one leg .
It is really different from usual .
Tahiti is very mystic island .
I enjoyed snorkeling around reef-fringed islands. ( a reef-fringed island )
I watched the beautiful sun setting on the skyline every day .
It was an amazing and liberating experience .
There were many Japanese newlyweds in the hotel where we stayed .
I wanted to get away from civilization and crowds .
So it was actually quite awkward when I met them in restaurant in the hotel .
This book helps me write e-mails .
Before the test , I have to make ready many materials for the students. You can also use : I have to prepare many materials for the students. Also , " I have to ready something , " is usually used in the context of preparing a machine or contraption. Eg. I have to ready the car for the trip tomorrow .
Some students may forget to bring their pencil ( s ) .
Some students may not know their test room and get lost. Since you are using the plural ( " Some students " ) , you can not use " his " or " her " in the rest of the sentence , since they are not plural .
The built-in speaker in the test room may suddenly break .
I am very shy , so I have difficulty improving my English speaking ability .
When my husband and I went to Tahiti , my husband asked me , ( We usually use a comma and not a period before quotations ) .
" Why do you speak English with such a hushed voice ? Ahh... I 'm sorry , I crossed out " sheep 's voice " because I have never heard of such an expression in English. I replaced it with " hushed , " which means " quiet and low. "
He ca n't speak English , but he looked like he had a lot of confidence. Also possible : He ca n't speak English , but he looked very confident .
Unlike last year , this season 's contestants look like they have no confidence in their own ability .
I very much empathize with them .
I suggest combining this sentence with the one above like so : If I am confident , I may be able to overcome my weak point .
Yesterday , my boss'guest came from Australia .
I served her some tea as an office clerk .
In such situation , should I say something to her ?
I did n't respond to her .
One of the two wears a mask to prevent giving us her cold .
Though , I wish she would wear a mask , how about in other countries ?
In your country , does a person with a cold wear a mask to avoid spreading a virus ?
I am walking with my feet sliding along the floor .
My husband and I live on the second floor .
The residents who are living on first floor sometimes complain to us .
They said " Why are you so noisy ? , " even though we live normally .
We do n't think we are noisy , but they said that they are troubled by noise from the second floor .
They said that we should not take a bath after 10 : 00pm , and we should live in the business district , because this is a quiet neighborhood .
This apartment was made very cheaply , but the rent is high , which caused this problem .
Anyway , my husband and I will walk with our feet sliding along the floor in our flat , just like a NINJA !
We hold a Halloween Party to get to know each other .
We played the " mummy game. "
The fastest team wins !
All the mummies made from toilet paper made us laugh .
I feel a difference in our national characters. ( Though I find that your sentence is correct also , I think that using a plural form helps show the contrast between the national characters more ) .
She shows her feelings strongly when she is angry. You can not say " She feels strong " because then strong would be the adjective that describes the person. You need to use " strongly , " which is an adverb that will describe the verb , in this case , " shows her feelings. "
The Japanese do n't really anger like that , especially in the office. OR : Japanese people do n't really like anger like that , especially in the office .
I just try to get used to it .
In fact , I find her to be very terrible,
but it is a very good opportunity to understand
I watched " The Sixth Sense. "
Yesterday , I watched " The Sixth Sense " on TV .
I just happened to catch the last 10 minutes .
Since it was something msterious , I was caught up in the story in a moment .
And all of a sudden I noticed what the twist was. ( 'twist ' = 'secret ' , used when talking about movies )
You should n't watch this movie from the last scene ! !
My husband and I work out during the weekend by jogging .
I 'm not quite sure what you mean by this sentence... ^ ^ ; . Is it in the sense of " Many people are fans of jogging in nature. " ?
We are very busy on weekdays. Writing formally in English , one does not usually begin a sentence with " because. "
I suggest : Of course , I also have to cook .
My husband spent a relaxing time with a newspaper spread out in front of him .
I enjoy the taste and smell of coffee , while reading a paperback .
I love happy holidays .
I have to go my company for work.Although you do n't own the company , we say my company to show that it is the place you normally work. It is the same as saying " At my school ... "
Tomorrow , I will also go to the factory for stocktake. You need to use 'will ' to show future tense.The correct word is 'stocktake'. You take note of the stock
As an accountant I usually work hard from the end of month till the 6th of next month .
Everyday , I start at 8 : 00 am and finish at 7 : pm . If it is the end of the month , I often work until 9 : pm .
I 'm an assistant for an accountant in a foreign company .
In addition , I would also like to exchange Vietnamese culture with someone who would like to study Vietnamese culture and language .
This is my Ninth story
There was no one on basketball court .
There was no one at the basketball court .
Yeah , it was a little bit cold to play basketball and it was late. This sentence is correct , but it sounds more natural as : " Yeah , it was late and a little to cold to playing basketball , but I did anyway. "
< meta charset = " utf-8 " > Yeah , it was late and a little to cold to be playing basketball , but I did it anyway .
I played basketball alone .
A few minutes later , someone came to the court and played basketball .
After a few minutes later , someone came to the court and started playing basketball .
We played together ten minutes later .
Then , we played together for ten minutes .
I had a lot of conversations with him during while playing .
We had a lot of conversations with him during playing. ( This sentence sounds weird to me i think you can say : I conversed with him a lot while playing. )
We talked a lot as we were playing .
After we played two games , we became friends .
After we played two games , we became a friends .
" we became friends " is correct .
There are many ways to make a friend .
There are many ways to make friends. ( the expression in English is just : make friends , not make a friend. Even though you can say that but usually we say make friends. )
And I think one of the best ways to do it is by exercising together .
And I also think it 's one of the best ways to exercise together .
We can get closer after we play something together .
We t became closer after we played something together .
So I love playing something ( " something " is correct , but " sports " is better ) .
I took an exam yesterday .
The name of the exam was " MCAS. "
You might know of this exam because it is for earning an international computer license .
MCAS is the acronym for Microsoft Certified Application Specialist. Initials are used for names .
I took the exam on Powerpoint .
I got ( Suggestion : " I scored 940 points. " Sounds a lot better. ) 940 points ( you need to get at least 700 point to pass the exam ) . I was very happy because I studied by myself .
Most people study for this test in an academy .
Because they want to get the license quickly , they spend a lot of money to take the exam. ( When you start the sentence with " Because.. " you state the reason first , then the action. )
That 's why people prefer to study in the academy .
But I decided to study by myself and I finally got my first license .
Of course , it took me about a month. ( it 's two times longer than studying in the academy ) I 'm studying the other subjects by myself .
It 's My Sixth Story
The weather gets warm and the mountains are changing green. ( -ing form of the verb " change " matches with the present tense , " are " )
But the weather has been terrible for the past few days. ( I changed " a few days " to " past few days " to match the past tense of " has " )
Three days ago , it snowed a lot .
It had snowed for nine hours. The height of snow might have been about 5 cm .
When I woke up the next morning , the world had changed to white .
So most of the snow melted away soon .
I had to go out to work. I felt like I would be blown away in the rain .
My pants were wet when I came to the office .
I hear that the temperature has dropped below zero .
And it is also windy .
I go to work by bicycle andmy hands seem to be frozen. ( instead of saying " my hands seem to be frozen , " you can also say " my hands feel like they are freezing " )
My collegue says that the situations in the movies might really happen. ( you can also say " My colleague says that whatyou see in the movies might really happen " )
Of course , it is not true , but I think it might be possible in the future .
Therefore I think we have to do something to fix nature. ( sounds more natural )
I read an English newspaper about the/a accident that happened in Detroit
I read an English news about the/an accident happened in Detroit ( sorry , I accidently wrote " a " ) ( if the accident is very well known , then write " the accident , " if it is not very well known write " an accident " )
( The owners ) did n't even notice it was missing until the next morning .
It 's a kind of cookie which is very interesting .
You will get a message which predicts your day once you split the cookies. < 'after ' is correct , but in this sentence , 'once ' has the meaning 'immediately when' .
People buy it just for fun .
And there was a message like this : " It will be a luck day. " I did n't care about it since I bought it just for fun .
But today is really a happy day. < you do n't believe the prediction , but it really came true .
I ca n't tell you about that exactly , but it is a very lucky day for me .
And I think it is a good idea to buy this cookies , even though it 's just for fun .
And I think it is a good idea to buy these cookies , even though it 's just for fun .
I will buy more of it later .
I will buy more of them later .
( You should my second diary before you read my fifth story. " Dairy " is milk or milk-based products like cheese .
I have n't been able to see her for a few days .
I tried to find her in the building , but Icould n't find her .
I amhappy when I saw her...If you use " was , " it means you feel happy in the past , now you do n't .
If she comes back , I will talk to her... .
It 's my seventh story
Since using this site , I have more opportunities to read other people 's essays .
I have studied English by myself before I knew the site , so I did n't have a chance to read them .
Now , I can read a lot of essays written by English learners .
Actually , I am surprised by their writing .
They do n't make mistakes in their sentences and they use very nice words .
Their expressions are also good .
Thinking about it more and more makes me lose my confidence .
I was in a slump for the last few weeks .
And now , I 'm going to start again .
It may be swollen .
These days , I reciteEnglish articles loudly right after I wake up .
Now , I 'm drinking a lot of water , but it has no effect .
I hate having injections .
I had some trouble with a college .
But I did n't do anything wrong .
So I cleaned my office instead of working during the morning. the placement of this sounds weird to me. I think you can say : So in the morning , instead of working , I cleaned my office instead .
I always clean up my room when I 'm upset. you can also say : I always clean my room , instead of clean up .
I can forget the bad feeling while i am cleaning my room .
It 's been a long time since I visited this site .
because i had a lot of things to do .
I decided to study english this year and I finally thought of Lang-8 !
So , I came back !
I hope you will be my English teacher or friend .
Add me to your friend list .
I 'll be waiting for your request .
However , I was worried that I could n't make friends once I joined this site .
However , I was worried that I could make friends before I joined this site. ( I think you mean could n't )
However , I was worried that I could make friends before I joined this site. ( I think you mean could n't )
However , I was worried that I would n't be able to make friends before joining this site .
I hesitated for a few days to join this site .
Finally , I joined but it was sad at the beginning because nobody corrected my diaries .
Finally , I joined but it was sad at the beginning , because nobody corrected my diary. ( Try not to start a new sentence with because. )
Finally , I joined but it was sad at the beginning , because nobody corrected my diary. ( Try not to start a new sentence with because. )
So I thought that it was a waste of my time .
Then , I stopped using this site .
Yet when I entered the site again , I found that someone had corrected my First diary. ( you can use 'logged on ' to replace 'entered'. )
When I entered the site last , I found that someone corrected my first diary .
When I entered the site last , I found that someone corrected my first diary .
Thus , I decided to use this site more often .
After that , I began to make more friends .
Now , I have many friends and I exchange a lot of emails with them .
And I exchange a lot of emails with them .
And I exchange a lot of emails with them .
It really helps me to study English and makes me study harder than before .
Hay fever
I have hay fever .
My eyes itch and my nose is ticklish .
In such train , when I can not stop sneezing , I feel very terrible .
I am now studying the lens systems ofmovie cameras .
I would like to fabricate the camera for a 3D movie. ( do you mean replicate ? )
But the design of the lens system is very difficult for me .
Today , it is sleeting ( snowy rain ) and the wind is roaring in Tokyo , Japan .
In spring we sometimes have snow , but in winter we usually have little snow .
Presentation on thursday .
This semester I am going to do T. A. work .
work .
So I have to make a presentation in front of almost 400 freshmen this Thursday .
Most of them are good at English because they lived in English speaking nations. ( " Countries " is better than " nations " here , both are correct though. )
The following is my script .
Recently,
smartphones like the iPhone and social network services like Facebook and Twitter have become very popular .
But do n't you think that this is a just the beginning of something ?
So our objective is to design the next generation of social network services or social network supporting tools that can be run on smartphones or handheld devices , and that also use mobile sensors actively .
The most important thing is to be creative .
During the project , you may have to deal with issues like privacy , security and usability .
These are examples of current services , but we are expecting your more brilliant ideas .
Then you may beat Mark Zuckerberg , who created Facebook in his dorm room while only 23 years old , and is now the youngest billionaire in the world .

The mutually beneficial concept of " I scratch your back , you scratch mine " is not only attractive but it works well in reality .
It is not because of money or to get certain rewards. It is the good mind that motivates people to do something and it makes a community .

And the community gives help to all the individual members in the community in turn .

Although I had full of stomach because of a late lunch , I followed him .

I think he was satisfied with the fact that I registered for a doctoral degree course .
I think he was pleased with the fact that I registered for a doctoral degree course. ( Satisfied means content but not particularly happy or excited. If something is satisfactory , that means it 's OK , it 's acceptable , but not great , so I think " pleased " would be a better word here. )
It will be the first time that he has a PhD
Frankly , I am not sure that I can be a great researcher , or that I can even get a PhD degree .
Frankly , I am not sure that I can be a great researcher , or that I can get a PhD degree at least , but I have started. ( " or that I can get a PhD degree at least " = > 더 자 연 스 럽 게 : " or that I can even get a PhD " )
I will try my best .
It 's a rainy day
Today it 's a rainy day
So the rain was falling on my bare head .
After the rain .
Well I got the information about this web on the Chinese Twitter ( Sina-Weibo )
I think this is an amazing idea , communicating and learning language like this
Today was a rainy day .
During the time , I cut wax to make original partern of silver accesories on business. Sorry , I 'm not sure what you want to say in this sentence .
After she returned home,
her class 's new teacher came .
She said that she was planning to visit eight students .
She stayed at my home for only fifteen minutes .
I think there is a difference between teachers of kindergarten and elementary school. I think this is what you want to say ?
I am from China and am an English major from the college of Wuhan City , HuBei Province .
I just registered thanks to one of my good friends who said that you can meet and make friends with people from all over the world by correcting diaries written by others or having your own corrected .
I also think it is a good and efficient way to improve our ability of using a foreign language well during our studies. " Masterly " sounds very awkward .
So , I am very happy and excited to meet good friends here .
And I am looking forward to letting everyone correct my " homework " and helping me to make progress everyday !
I am very happy today because I saw a wonderful scene---the full Solar Eclipse,which happened in most areas of China around 9 : 26 am Beijing time on 22,July,2009 .

But when it was about 8 : 14,the moon started to cover the sun .

Likewise,my elder sister took some exciting photoes about the wonders today,although they are not very clear due to the annoying clouds .
I bought some comic books today .
Do you know about this comic ?
There are many famous comics in Japan .
I heard that some foreigners are interested in Japanese Manga culture .
I think that Manga is very interesting .
Because most Japanese tend to consider Manga to be juvenile books .
I guess football is the most popular sport in Europe .
I played football from the age of 9 to 14 .
When I was 12 years old , I was elected delegate player of the football team of the prefecture .
And then , we faced the Korean team for an international match .
It was a very exciting game and this game was the best match ever .
After that both teams , Japan and Korea , ate/had lunch together .
We could n't understand each others languages but we had a lot of fun .

Three months have passed since I wrote my last diary .
However , I will try to write diary as frequently as possible from now on .
Yesterday , I was elected ( chosen ) as a foreign internship student .
I 'm going to the Philippines .
Japan is considered as one of the more advanced nations , but there are still many developing countries around the world .
These countries are being watched by many advanced nations with interest .
I want to be an civil engineer and help the development of these countries. ( a possessive on the plural word of " countries " seems a little weird to me )
So , for the benefit of my future , I think I need to see the real
condition of these countries ; the society , food , culture , etc.. .
So I 'm looking very forward to going to the Philippines .
They are a Japanese rock band , and are composed of four players .
There are many cool songs... ( or.. They have many cool songs. " )
For example , " Fire Cracker , " " I hate it , " " Space Sonic..... "
However , they broke up in 2008 .
After that , the vocal of their band , Takeshi Hosomi started a new band " the Hiatus. "
After that , the vocal of their band ( or... " lead vocalist " ) , Takeshi Hosomi started a new band " the Hiatus. "
This band is really cool , and the atmosphere of their songs are little different from the ELLEGARDEN 's .
ELLEGRDEN is known as a rock ( punk ) band , and most of their songs are up-tempo .
But in the Hiatus , the type of each song are different .
Even though their songs are great , I hope ELLEGARDEN would get back together .
Good opinion or bad opinion any opinion is okay. ( or... Any opinion is okay : good or bad. )
I want to hear many thoughts .
I want to hear many thoughts .
I want to look around the traditional view and eat Philippine food .
I want to become friends with them and improve my English through conversation .
Does it mean something " evil " ? It is likely one of the biggest challenges of modern human history , one of the toughest problems humankind ever faced since it 's on a global scale , its sheer enormity and complexity. ( questions , even rhetorical , should end in a question mark )
That the Earth is getting hotter and hotter means that more and more solar energy is accumulating inside the Earth 's atmosphere .
I see , the most difficult is that they 're not concentrated enough , the energy is distributed throughout a certain area so it 's not as easy to collect as a piece of coal or nuclear material and burn it up .
Why do they have to resolve the question about distributed energy by the size of the " power plants " ( e.g. huge wind turbines )
I wonder why it 's so hard to get such kinds of energy .
A typical answer I often find is that there is no money .
It seems the only nation with enough money and capability is the US .
And more its government can spend hundreds of billions of dollars to wage a war on some unlucky guys in the deserts of the Middle East ( another glorious victory that hardly any other nation thinks they dare to do - overthrow a government with it military power ranks 4th in just a few weeks ) , yet it feels reluctant to spend more money on serious scientific and technical projects that have the possibility to change the world .
I had heard about the novel and its author a long long time ago , back when I was a
Quite frankly , I tried several times to read it but all failed .
was that it 's a 18th century work , used classical written language , so it was tough for me to
Do n't know why but now I just could handle it .
I still have not read through the whole work yet
really moving .
The young girl , the main character , her name is Lin Da Yu , after being sick
for a while , is still weak but she tries to stroll out for some fresh air .
Now , I 'm burying flowers .
But do you know who would bury me someday ?
Remnants of the glorious spring , all the flowers are gradually falling .
I 'll put it all
The Japan versus Korea International Friendship Football game was held in Seoul yesterday .
During the first half , the Japanese attacked aggressively with short passes , but the Korean players defended themselves with their amazing physical ability .
In contrast with the first half , the Korean players had the ball most of time during the latter half and at times they got close to making goals , but the Japanese goalee prevented them from doing so at the end .
Though it was a friendship match , both teams made it a very suspenseful game .
Since the next world cup will held in Brazil in 2014 , I hope both of teams improve their technique and tactics. Hopefully they can make it beyond the final 16 , which was result of this year 's world cup game .
Typhoon No.14 is coming .
Sendai 's 14th typhoon is coming. ( Sounds more natural )
The chilling rain has been falling since yesterday .
Since my room , which I rent is inexpensive , it is cold. Right now , I am in a warm lab about a 5 minutes walk from my room .
I do n't like cold rain because I am likely to get a cough easily. ( You want to use the word " cold " here. When English speakers say cold , usually it means we have a cough and feel sick. )
Super saiyajin Goku , owned by my neighbor , is looking out at the dark outside. Anxious about coughing .
As for today 's challenge , I used a relative pronoun , but I 'm uncertain how to use it.. .
I was surprised to know that it was Momoe Yamaguchi .
I know her name but I had thought she was just late 70 's old idol and sang popular songs during that time .
Her songs are not even old now , and they sound like real rock 'n roll .
During my search about her , the fact that she finished her career when she was only 22 astounded me .
I like her music , I considered it good rock music !
Yesterday , the AFC ( Asian Football Confederation ) championship semi final match between Japan and South Korea was held in Qatar .
But they did this time. // When changing the time frame from " the past 6 years " to " now/ this time , " it should be explicitly stated .
During the game , Japan ran well and South Korea showed tough physicality and good ability .
I did n't know the members of South Korea well , but after kick-off , I was surprised that they are very tall and young .
They played very gentle , I want to clap and cheer for them. // With just 'cheer ' you do n't need 'for ' , but since you have 'clap ' here too and 'clap ' requires 'for ' , it must be added .
However there was only one disappointing thing .
I thought referee called fouls more easily than usual .
If there were fewer calls , we could watch a more exciting dynamic match .
Anyway I 'm crossing my fingers that both teams can win their next games .
The day before yesterday , we lab members held an Imoni party .
An Imoni party is a kind of BBQ made by filling a pot with aroid , Chinese cabbage , green onion , carrot , meat , and so on and is mainly made in Tohoku region which is located in northern part of Japan .
In autumn , the smoke from Imoni parties can be seen near every river in Tohoku .
In my hometown , Sendai , the pot is dressed with miso and pork is used .
The taste is like tonjiru which is a type of gorgeous miso soup full of vegetables .
In the neighboring prefecture , Yamagata , they use soy sauce as the main dressing and use beef .
The sweet and salty taste evokes Sukiyaki .
Since next year I am going to go to the Kanto region , this Imoni party might be the last one for me .
It was very enjoyable but that idea made me a little bit concerned .
The picture was shot a few years ago .
At the beginning of May , I went to the western part of Japan for sightseeing .
She 's been ill lately , so I went there to cheer her up .
I hope she will get well soon .
Kurashiki is one of the most favorite places I 've ever visited because there is a beautiful place named Bikan area .
The scenery made me feel relax and nostalgic .
I 'm a Japanese graduate student with two master 's degrees .
Now , I want to learn foreign languages , especially English .
I want to understand or just know about foreign culture ! It 's important to explain why , but since this sentence is good explanation , you do n't have to SAY the word " because. " It 's understood .
Thinking about foreign cultures is thrilling .
Since English is spoken all over the world , if I can use English , I can communicate with billions of people and learn about many countries .
I am going to write mainly about Japanese university life .
In Japan , there is tons of news about recent difficulties for university students hunting for jobs. [ " News " is uncountable , so uses the singular verb , like : " there is tons of sugar in the cupboard. " ]
Unfortunately , the rate of students who could get work till October in this fiscal year went down to 58 % from 63 % last year. Unfortunately , the rate of students able to find work up to October went down from 68 % last year to only 58 % this fiscal year .
And there is a lot of controversy about what is the main problem. [ The controversy is about the one subject matter. We would tend to use " controversies " ( plural ) if there were many controversies about many different matters. ]
There is a lot of work , especially in middle and small companies. [ " Work " is uncountable - like " news " and " sugar " above ! : ) ]
They only apply to big famous companies .
If students learned their limitations well , they could get work. " If students understood their limitations well/better... [ I think if you wanted to use " learned , " then " if students had learned... " would make more sense to me. ]
Others insist , " There are many more students than ever before .
The number of university students has been increasing , it 's double compared to 1990. [ Students is a countable noun. " The number of... " for countable nouns , " the amount of... " for uncountable nouns. E.g. " the amount of sugar , " " the amount of news. " ]
Now , the undergraduate degree is less special than it used to be. "
Most of the/these opinions are hard on students .
So , the students who are exhausted or getting angry about job hunting held a demonstration / started to demonstrate / demonstrated .
University does n't provide good/any preparation for job hunting !
Japan is in a depression right now.. .
Lately , my eyes have been getting tired because I 've spent so/too much time sitting in front of a/my computer display .
I usually carry out/do experiments in the lab and analyze the data by computer .
When I felt exhausted , watching the news of the world was my favorite way to rest .
It was good for my feeling but not for my eyes ( xx ) [ " good for my feeling " sounds a little strange... It was good for my exhaustion , but not for my eyes. ? The problem is " feeling " has special meanings. ]
So I bought a Rubik 's cube .
At first , I could n't do well , though I read/looked at the operating manual .
But after doing it more than 5 times , I learned how to do the Rubik 's cube correctly !
My next target is to do the cube fast like below .
Distance between me and him seems to be long .
Sendai is getting a little cold and autumn is coming .
Sendai is getting colder as autumn approaches .
I like autumn because I like the color of brown and the fallen leaves .
I like autumn because I like the color of the brown , fallen leaves .
Fallen leaves make me feel the fragility of life .

Anyway , I 've been on the track and field club for 11 yearssince junior high school .
Anyway , I 've been in the track and field club for 11 years ever since junior high school .
Since I 'm a relatively thin , high jump is my event .
Since I 'm relatively thin , I only participate in high jump .
Today , Sendai has a clear autumn sky , and a temperature that is not too hot or cold. Just right for me to relax .
Today , Sendai has a clear , autumn sky , a temperature which is not too hot or too cold. It is just right , making me feel relaxed .
It is very comfortable to lay on the mat for the high jump and stare absently into the skye on days where the weather is fair like today

Science ( Cafes ) [ note : Capitalize the first letter of each important word in a title. ]
I am going to start e ( working ) next year
But , [ comma ] I 'm already a little bit scared even though I have n't started working and do n't known ( very well ) about work .
So , [ comma ] I frequently imagine the ( post-retirement ) years ( ^ ^ ; )
And , [ comma ] I like ( cafes as well ) .
So I want to integrate science ( into a ) cafe atmosphere [ no comma ] and will name it ( " Science Cafe " ) .
I ( imagine ) a lot of scientific ( stuff like ) astrometric ( telescopes ) , test ( tubes ) with flowers , gas ( burners ) on the table , ( flasks ) as a drink shaker , and vacuum tube ( amplifiers ) for good music .
( On holidays ) , children could come to play and study ... .
After ( being lost in imagination ) , I ( disappointedly ) ( remember ) the debt ( I incurred ) for scholarship .
If there were good ( applications ) of the scientific devices ( in ) the cafe , I ( would ) want to know .
It 's been several weeks since I posted my last diary entry .
During the last few weeks , I had been practicing for the Ekiden , a meeting organized by electrical faculty of the graduate university .
First , I will try to explain about Ekiden .
But the big difference between full marathon and Ekiden is that you can run alone or not .
In Ekiden , a runner is equiped a Tasuki which is like a towel bonding its edges as a baton .
To express ( describe ) the appearance of the Tasuki is very difficult : p
Each runner runs their own course and gives the Tasuki to the next runner .
So we had the Ekiden meet last Saturday .
2 years ago , we got 5th place ( prize ) and last year we got 4th place ( prize ) .
Since we had good freshman and practice , we got 3th place ( prize ) !
So , we had the most enjoyable time in the Oden party after the Ekiden since the past 3 years .
I hope junior colleagues get a better result next year .
I 'm now watching an Egyptian demonstration on Web TV .
They seem to have stopped to connect the internet. ( This is hard to understand. Did you mean they they stopped connecting or ca n't connect to the internet ? Or do you mean that they stopped in the park so that they could connect to the internet ? ? )
I have a plan to visit America in August .
I applied for a passport last Monday , and I can pick it up today .
So , I was going to go for passport this morning,
I forget the paper which I need for the passport at university .
I have to go to the pick-up window after going to the university .
As I have 4 class between 10 : 30 and 18 : 00
and the pick-up window is closed at 18 : 00,
Today I decided to attempt to write something .
I usually find it easy to read technical documents and watch films in English but absolutely ca n't write in English .
I wanted to help somebody , but there are not many people who study the russian language .
I love my language , foreigners say that it is weird and that it is difficult to study , they are just afraid of difficulties. ) ) ) )
I am proud to be Russian and to speak Russian , but it has a downside : I ca n't get rid of my accent , because we have a strong and tough pronunciation .
1st of September is the worst day , ( that day ) my studies will begin.. .

There were so many people ; like polite and nice Japanese , Korean , who laugh the all time , crazy smoked african full of This sentence is a grammatical nightmare , there are just to many commas. English speakers would n't speak like this. You 'd be better off to break it into separate sentences .
I ca n't even remember them all... ) )
I am waiting for your comments , it would be so nice of you to correct me ! ) )
Writing " u " instead of " you " , " cuz " instead of " because " and " yr " instead of " your " is a bad habit which I caught from the Americans. I ca n't help it .
I watched this movie today.. .
I was searching for this movie for quite some time now .
I do n't know why it was removed from Russian DVD shops for being " too christian. "
Probably only 5 % of it 's plot is christianity and the rest of it is a love story.. .
There is fairy tale about love or a tale about fairy love.. .
And I could n't stop crying.. .
I have never cried over films , this was the first film which touched me so deeply .
I would also like to talk about the actor 's amazing performance and its great soundtracks.. .
I got used to traditional American happy endings and I hoped that everything would be all right until the last moment.. .
The name of the film translated into Russian is called " Hurry to love , " I think it is a good name.. .

The government and media cry " Attention please ! " But I know almost all students are happy with the clothing of their school. [ I 'm confused why you 're suddenly writing about clothing and school here... It 's grammatically correct , but I do n't understand... ]
And maybe they 'll go out shopping or something .
I think there are no means to prevent the expansion .
I have a question about how this flu affair is being treated in other countries. or How is this flu affair being treated in other countries ?

Sehuri clean up climbing. Whats 'clean up ' refering to ?
Sehuri with my clubmates. It is located near my school .
The reason for climbing is because my club held the Sehuri climbing event .

They seemed to have enjoyed the events , but there are room for improvement .

In his photos , I look prettier than usual ; )
If I can get his address , I would write to him soon !

but actually , life just means ordinary things that are happening daily .
Northeastern Asia consists of China , Japan , and Korea ( including North Korea and South Korea ) .
They are three ( four ? ) of the most important countries in the world , both politically and economically .

Yesterday I was unlucky. Your point would get across clearer if you said you were veryunlucky. But that 's just my opinion .
I was_found to have written wrong years on very important documents.The sentence could also be " I found that I had written the wrong years on very important documents. " but for now I 'll make the least amount of changes. '_ ' mean spaces , the site has trouble putting spaces between corrections and words .
I would suggest putting this before or after you talk about the mistake. It breaks the flow of thought. Try putting it either after " Yesterday I was unlucky. , " before " Second , I lost my cellphone , " or maybe after " I am very regretful. "
I have to go correct the documents .
The documents relate my future 's job. It depends , do the documents relate to your future job now ? Or do they not relate to it now , but will in thefuture ?

I want to go , but I do n't have time because I have an important exam on the next day when they 'll come back. [ " they 'll come back " / " they are coming back " ]

If the trip were on another day , I could go .

I went to school , and my teachers gave me alot of homework as X'mas presents .
In my school , there are four groups in the swimming club and I belong in the Hayama group
The Hayama group is different from normal swimming clubs .
In the summer,_there is a big event where we swim a very long distance ( 30km-40km for example ) in the sea .
Because it is very physically demanding , we usually practice hard .
I swam about 7000m yesterday , and I have serious muscle pain. OR my muscles are very sore .

I 'd like to share a story about a man who is my friend and a woman who is his girlfriend .
One day , She served him a meal .
He ate it and said " Oh,this bread is nice and tastes good. "
Suddenly , she got angry and said " Are you trying to say that only the bread is good and that my cooking is not ? "
He was surprised that she said this .
On another day , after a meal , he said to her " I had your meal deliciously. "
She was angered and said " You 're saying that you my cooking was bad and that you were able to successfully eat it all. " This quote is rather confusing , sorry if my editing changes the meaning , I 'm just not sure what you are intending the man 's wife to be saying .
The following day , he told me about it and he told me that he does n't know what he should say to her .
Are these examples just differences in the thinking of men and women ?
or should he choose what he says more carefully ?
Happy New year !
We appreciate your recalibration on your permit , contacting your research result of backbone and of technical prospects of the ( be specific ) equipment .
Thank you for your cooperation this year .

suggest : But it feels unhappy .
Everything was ok until high school , then I was under a lot of pressure to pass the 수 능 test ( kind of like the SAT ) . Though I did n't get great marks .
But after entering the university , I 'm very nervous .
After a few years I have to get a job. Although I 'm still young , it 's stressful .
And This year ( 2009 ) , I 'm planning to go to Australia on a working holiday .
For about a month , I lived without any idea ( plans ? ) cause I wanted to separate from reality .
But in the new year , I have to move .
That 's why it is n't just delightful .
Do you have any plans for the new year ?
Anyhow , Happy new year ! ( " Anyway " is more natural )

The Intermadiate class may be a little hard for me .
But as for intermediate class study free-talking so even if it will be beyond me , I want to try it .

Why english is felt like loads for me ? Why does learning English feel like a burden to me ? ( Is that what you 're trying to say ? )
I want to talk English with native speakers every day .
Cause I do n't want to study at a desk.. .
But It isnt easy,
But it is n't easy,

When I was elementary school student , rollerskating was very popular .
When I was an elementary school student , at that time rollerskating i rollerskating was very popular. .
When I was an elementary school student , rollerskating was very popular .
So I used to play with my friends everyday .
So I used to play with my friends every day. ( 'everyday ' is only used as an adjective before a noun , so your original sentence was correct )
One day , I rollerskated with 2 friends
Suddenly , I slipped and fell. My left ankle was sprained .
It was really , really painful .
My two friends approached me and said " Are you ok ? "
Actually , I was n't ok because I felt like I almost died but I replied , " I 'm ok. "
Since it was so painful , I could n't dare to go home alone by walking .
However , my character is a little shy .
However , I was a very shy person .
So I could n't ask anyone to help me .
One friend said to me , " Shall I take you home ? "
I said politely , " No , I can go home alone. " ( OK ! !
At that time , the other friend said to one friend,
" I do n't care. She said she can go home alone. "
I was in pain so I could n't think anything,
but then I could think of this. .
'Damn it ' : - ( I could have kept our friendship ! ! !
Anyway , finally I said I will go home alone and so I went home alone while nearly creeping. [ creeping.. maybe use another word.. ah , but I ca n't figure a replacement for it now @ _ @ ; ]
Anyway finally I said I would go home alone [ , ] and so I went home alone [ , ] nearly crawling. ( I think 'crawling ' might be better than 'creeping ' )
I arrived at home and I stayed in bed .
The next day , I wore a cast .
Although I went through that time , I got along with the other friend well , but I still disliked her and thank the helpful friend. [ It 's very confusing which two friends are you talking about. Please be more specific - I 'm not sure if I understood correctly. ]
At first , in my mind , I blamed myself after I parted from her .
However , I ca n't remember her name , but I remember she was a kind friend .
I watched one movie to familiarize myself ( or familiarise if you 're learning European English ) with the British English accent .
It 's a teen movie .
Though its story is obvious , the handsome lead man made me happy : D
As I watched that movie about 4-5 times , the OST is quite accustomed to hear. ( ? I do n't understand. )
The band The Stiff Dylans ! ( You do n't need aposrophes for bands = ) )
The man is a part of the band in movie , then they sang two songs. ( Write out your numbers )
One is " Ever Fallen in Love , " the other is " Ultraviolet. " ( Captialize titles and put the quotation maks after periods. )
A good looking TV star is better , but for singers , having an attractive voice is most important thing to me .
After watched that movie , I visited ( or went on ) the England site , because I could n't find , downloaded the band 's songs .
I found more of their songs and one site where I can download a variety songs .
Oops , actually , 'Ever fallen in love'is n't their song and there 's many versions sung by many singers. ( We call that a cover song when someone plays a song from another band. )
I love The Stiff Dylans ' version .
Before this movie , my favorite was the " Mamma Mia " OST .
Already as you know , all these are famous ABBA songs .
Of course I had known a few of their songs , but had n't liked them very much .
However after watching 'mamma mia ' , I downloaded all the songs , and played then over and over again .
The men who is better than flower ? 'OST is very nice too. ( Do you mean Boys Over Flowers ? Hana Yori Dango , I think. )
How powerful OST is !
My heroes are the patriots .
It was about second grade in elementary school when I first thought about my hero .
One day , the teacher gave me a paper which asked a few questions about me .
One of the questions asked 'who do you respect ? ' .
I started to think of someone who is a worthy answer to that question .
Eventually , I thought of someone .
His name is King Seo-Jong .
He created Han-gul with the help of scholars to improve his nation .
At the time , we were using Chinese character .
? not quite sure what you mean by this one. Maybe " We borrowed these characters for writing "
There characters were n't really ours and many people were illiterate .
What do you mean unreal hero ? Like he was n't a realistic hero ?
Later on during high school I enjoyed the subject 'Korean modern history ' from the Joseon era to present time .
Even though I 'm not good at Korean history , I used to get good grades in Korean modern history .
I do n't know if you already knew , but at one point Korea was a colony of Japan .
Not quite 100 % sure what you mean in this one .
There were many patriots who resisted .
They resisted not only by force , but also by writing poems , novels , etc. ( I especially like the ? resistive ? poem )
They were not afraid of death and some patriots sacrificed themselves for their country .
Could I do that if it happen again ?
I am really thankful to them and every ancestors who made an effort to protect our culture .
One thing more , It 's unfortunate that descendants of the traitors are very wealthy because they inherited many things by flattering the Japanese .
Patriots ' descendants , on the other hand , are really poor since their father or grandfather gave-up their family to devote himself ( Usually men ) .
Their families could n't afford education .
I wish that they got more respect .
I , however,grew up at Tokyo .
Everytime I go back to Tokyo and see the Tokyo Tower , I feel relaxed .
I work for a trading company which gets fossil fuel from Asian countries such as China and Indonesia , and sells them to iron manufacturers , power plants , papermaking companys , and so on .
I have studied English since April , 2009 .
But I 'm not good at English .
I wan na speak English fluently .
And I wish to meet a lot of foreigners on this site .
I certainly want to study or live abroad on day .
That 's why I 'm learning English .
I write a diary entry for the first time lol .
English is difficult to learn lol .
I am only learning English for my job .
Today 's diary is short and ends here .
Hahahahahahahahahahhaha !
I cooked some food this morning for lunch .
After a long time , I finally finished cooking .
Luckily it turned out to be delicious !

Therefore , when lunch came the meal was very delicious .
Please correct my grammar .

Can you answer some questions for me ?
Sorry for taking up your time .
1 , Until now , did any genetically modified food enter your country from USA , Brazil etc. such as soybean , corn etc. -- ( We usually call them genetically modified food or GM food instead of transgenic food. )
2 , How does your government and the populace see GM food ?
3 , Do you think that GM food will finally reach your dinner table ?
Why ?
4 , Would you choose GM food at the supermarket ?
I 'd like to briefly describe the Chinese Spring Festival .
I had prepared a lot of food , such as dumplings , meat balls , fish , etc in the new year 's eve like the previous spring festival , so that I did n't need to buy anything during the vacation .
I stuck couplets on two sides of the door of my parents house , after that I worked some firecrackers , eating dumplings , watching the Spring Festival gala play on TV while my family spent the whole day with my parents at their house .
And my family spent the whole day with my parents on the first day of Chinese New year .
My family also spent the whole day with my parents-in-law on the second day of the Lunar New Year .
I had had dinner with close friends , relations and colleagues for drinking wine on the third day , the fourth day and sixth day .
I went to the Catacombs to worship the ancestor on the fifth day as tradition .
I went to work and started working on the seventh day .
The mandarin is the language that many kinds of north nomads or minority nationality enter or invaded the Central Plains had been belonging to Han nationally in ancient Chinese , then imitate and try to speak to the ancient han nationality , then learning not too good , so became the so called mandarin. ( 我 不 明 白 . 原 句 子 是 什 么 ? )
So I think that those place with dialect of south of the Yangtze River is more like or close the sound of ancient Han nationality especially cantonese and inland Min dialects almost as the ancient han nationality. ( 我 不 明 白 . 原 句 子 是 什 么 ? )
This explains why Cantonese literature is so rich and diverse compared to Mandarin literature in China ( , which is rather poor and shallow ) .
Do you want to know which animal year you belong to or by the Chinese zodiac signs ?
The Chinese zodiac is similar to the western astrological signs .
The chinese people like to own the animal 's character in their name characters .
The Chinese today tend to contrast animal characters with animal year that they belong to themselves .
In recent days , I have been saving a certain amount of money working part-time , because I wan na participate the " Contiki " tour .
Have any of you ever heard of it ?
It is a type of tour where everyone travels on one bus , with a companion from each country visited. The tour goes around the world .
I 'm very interested in taking this tour !
I wan na go to Paris , Las Vegas , New York City and so on .
Today , my brothers and I helped my father .
We went to feed the cows .
Because cattle food is very heavy , it is hard for me to distribute ( ? ) it .
So , I was more tired than usual .
after that , my brothers and I had dinner at a Chinese noodle shop near my house .
We ate noodles and Gyoza .
They were delicious .
Tomorrow , I will help my mother make orange juice .
It tires me too much / It it exhausting .
But I will work hard to help my mother .
Good night !
Last Saturday , I had a fight with my parents. /comment : / more natural to use " had a fight "
Because they did n't allow me to work part-time near my house .
The volunteer work is planned by my university .
Because I like to talk to other people. /alternatively : / " Because I like talking with people "
For example , I had to go home before sunset when I was a high school student .
I have to go home before 10 p.m. now. /Alternatively : / If you wish to use " until , " you can use it like this : " I can stay out until 10 PM now "
And they do n't like me working part-time. /Alternatively : / " And they do n't like it when I work part-time "
I quarrelled ( /argued ) with them for about an hour .
I cried a little , because they would n't ( /did n't ) understand me .
I wanted them to understand me .
Then ,my young brother helped me. /comment : / Remember that this happened in the past , so you have to use " Helped "
Finally,they understood me and allowed me to work part-time. /comment : / Same as above. Past -- > allowed
I want to work part-time on Wednesdays,Saturdays and Sundays. /comment : / You want to work part-time several Wednesdays ( and Saturdays and Sundays ) so you have to use plural form .
But they did n't allow me to work on Sundays .
But , my elder brother called them today .
He is living in Nagoya to attend ( unnecessary ) university .
He is a 3rd grade student /comment : / You have already said that he attends a university , so " at a university " becomes redundant and unnatural .
He told them that he would work part-time near his house .
they told him " it was good ! " ( or perhaps " that is good " ? ) /alternatively : / If you want to use " said , " you can use : " They said to him " instead of " they told him "
I was angry in my heart ! /comment : / Not really a much used expression. Perhaps " I was furious " works better ?
Today , my brother and I helped my mother make mandarin juice .
But , we had to use many mandarins to make it .
So we had to carry them from field to our house .
But , they were very heavy,so we were tired from carrying them and making juice .
After that , my brother and I had lunch .
After that , my brother and I helped my father feed cows .
Cows are very cute .
After that , I took a walk with my dog. -- or After that I took my dog for a walk. if the actual intention is to walk the dog/make the dog exercise .
My dog is n't very loyal .
But he is cute. I think it should be combined with the previous sentence = = > My dog is n't very loyal , but he is cute .
In the evening , I went to cram school English. Did you mean this ? = = > In the evening I went to English cram school .
Kitashima who was an important person to us .
The concert was held at the musical instrument museum and it was great .
Three friends of mine in Hamamatsu were going to travel by a camping car that evening .
They did n't plan where to stay , as usual .
It was extraordinalily r warm and comfortable that I had n't known at all .
Next morning when the car passed over Kobe , I made my mind up , not to get off the car , but to go to Hiroshima together with them .
Next morning when the car passed over Kobe , I changed my mind not to get off the car but to go to Hiroshima together with them .
The water was low when we visited ( I forgot how to describe this ) , so we were able to walk to the gate. ( / The tide was receding and the sea floor was exposed when we arrived so we were able to walk to the gate on foot )
There is a mountain called Misen where a famous Buddhism monk , Kuukai , opened a saint place .
Our stomachs were not big enough to taste all of them .
They were going to find a good onsen or hot spring for the night .
I remembered that an old friend boutht g a condo opposite Miyajima recently .
She recommended a good onsen nearby that she just went to the previous day .
She never told me what to do but she helped me make the goals clear on how to accomplish them myself .
We decided which day of the week and what time we will talk over the phone about what 's going on.There might be a better way on this to fix it but I just ca n't think of it at the current time .
The next day , my Hamamatsu friends went to another island named Shodo-shima , and I took a local train back to Kobe .
It was about 4,000 yen cheaper than shinkansen , but it took over 5 hours .
I could n't buy any food or drink till the second station because there was no time.alt : because I had no time .
5 pieces of gum eased me .
I enjoyed looking out of the window .
There were lots of green , pink and purple colours in the mountains.note : In American English spelling there is no " u " in color. However there is in British. Just wanted you to know. The same goes for a few other like-spelled words .
Things went back to normal yesterday.alt : My affairs were back. This is more formal , however , it covers you more specifically .
My friends are in Shikoku now and they are going to drop by my place tomorrow .
Next week , after the long holiday , they are going to Tohoku , the affected area by the earthquake and tsunami , by that camping car to help them clean the damaged things.alt : via the camping. with the " affected area " part just switch the two words around. On another note , depending on how you feel about comma 's you might just want to recreate the sentence .
Good news from the affected area ( " A " is incorrect here because " news " is a non-count noun ; " very , " on the other hand , just feels inappropriate in a serious title. )
This is some very good news .
Just now , an 80-year-old lady and a 16-year-old boy were rescued from under lots of debris in a town called Ishinomaki in Miyagi prefecture. ( Many countries do n't have " prefectures. " The first time you use a word that may be unfamiliar to your readers in a given text , it 's probably best to write it out in full. )
They are being taken to ( " into " is the motion from outside to inside. Unless the helicopter enters the hospital building , they are merely being taken " to " it by the helicopter ; the " into " will probably be by hand from the helipad. ) the hospital by helicopter. ( " by a helicopter " is grammatically okay , but think of " I go to school by bus. " )
That 's amazing and great ! ( [ adjective ] and [ adjective ] sounds a little awkward , but " amazing " refers to how hard to believe something is while " great " refers to how good it is , so in this situation the double-adjective is okay. But please try not to overuse punctuation. )
It 's been a while since I last wrote a journal entry .
I 'm sorry I have n't replied to each message yet that I received while I was absent , but I really appreciated them .
I 'm going to have a minor operation at a hospital this week .
I wo n't be able to go to Tokyo this time .
Luckily , she came to Kyoto for a four-day trip this Monday , so I went to see her there yesterday .
There is a famous temple named 東 寺 ( Toji ) near Kyoto station , and a big antique market is held there on the 21st of every month .
Yesterday was the very day .
We met at the station at about 10 : 30 and walked there .
There were lots of people gathered there and lots of stores selling old kimonos , food and hand crafts , as well as antiques .
I found an interesting carved ornament which cost 38,000 yen .
We walked around for a while , however , there were too many people and too many things to attract me !
We got in the queue at once .
That , I thought , was why it was popular. Or : I thought that that was why it was so popular. Yes , two " that. "
There were chairs for sitting .
A foreign couple , sitting next to us , were sharing a piece of ika-yaki .
She seemed to hate it .
Inside the temple , we also enjoyed seeing lots of statues of 曼 荼 羅 ( Mandala ) , Buddhism 's heaven and earth .
One of the statues named 帝 釈 天 ( Taishaku-ten ) ? ? ? ? riding an elephant was really handsome .
I did n't know that it was built as a grave of some saints and that it had burned down four times after it was first built in 883 , but it has never been destroyed by an earthquake .
Before leaving there nearly 4 : 00 , I dropped by the store again to just see the carved ornament once again , and then , surprisingly , the shope person started to give me a discount .
Before leaving , I dropped by the store again just to see the carved ornament once again , and then , surprisingly , the shop person offered me a discount .
He said , " It is very good , but you can buy it for 8,000 yen. " I could n't believe it because he was reducing the price by 30,000 yen .
He said , " It is very good , but you can buy it for 8,000 yen. " I could n't belive it because he was going to make as much as 30,000 yen discount .
I began to check it carefully , and then he even said , " Okay , it 's just 7,000 yen .
Please take it. " How can he discount it 31,000 yen ?
I thought to myself , " Perhaps , it was not as good as the price seemed to indicate at the beginning. " A customer 's mind , it 's funny , is n't it ?
This time , we took the train to get back to Kyoto station , even though it was only one-station distance .
After buying an 駅 弁 ( ekiben ) , a colourful delicious meal in a box , we talked again about our future plans at a cafe for a while .
We really had a nice time , and said good-bye at about 5 : 30 p.m .
I would really appreciate it if you would correct any incorrect usage or unnatural expressions of mine .
I thought it was just 'tissues ' even though they are pocket-sized , but I was not sure .
How about the case of tissues , which is made of bamboo , plastic or wood ? ( this sounds kind of strange. probably just : " How about the case of tissues ? " )
It 's a lovely weekend .
My family went to a nearby park named Soraku-en ( 相 楽 園 ) in Kobe this morning .
Hi my friends both in Japan and the rest of the world,
A week has passed ( already ) since the nightmare , but lots and lots of people are still suffering from saddness , coldness , fear and inconveniences .
Some of our lang-8 mates must be in trouble with daily foods and items .
I thank all of you over the world .
They will collect and send them to the victims directly .
Foreign people already started to return to their own countries .
And , the original one is read out by a Japanese famous actor , Ken Watanabe .
I only have 12 hours to study for my physiology oral exam .
If I took this exam now , I would n't pass it .

I had to seek for a job soon
I looked for a job in the internet and walked around the city to find a job
Maybe this place is a countryside
I saw many signs for rent
I saw many " for rent " signs
I decided to move to Sydney
I decided to move to Sydney
I went to interview with a Japanese sushi restaurant today
But honestly , I do n't want to workthere,

That 's what I expected
But I have no choice
I have decided go to Australia
I 'm going to have a working holiday in Australia in August .
I 'm going to take a working vacation in Australia this August .
I 've never been to any foreign country before .
I 'm very excited but at the same a little worried about how my lifestyle there would be .
I 'm looking for a house to rent .
I 'm looking for a shared rental house .
I still ca n't find one .
Australia has winter season now , how can i take it .
It will be winter in Australia , how can I deal with it ?
I do n't know how I can say what I 'm thinking .
Vietnam is peaceful and friendly , I love my country and anyone who love Vietnam .
I know my spelling is bad , but thank you for correcting it for me .
Today , my English teacher pointed out that I often tend to speak in an abstract way in conversation .
For example , when I say " go out in society " in a sentence ; he said I should use " start working " instead. ( You had too many commas before. : ) I 'd have to check the punctuation rules to make sure the semi-colon I used is correct )
In addition , he also said " international situation " can be paraphrased " what 's going on in the world , " and " feature " can be said " what makes us different. "
I become stressed when I learn the way of thinking that are shown in the expressions of the Japanese and English languages .
I went to a bar with my friends yesterday , and I got completely drunk .
I realized that I get drunk on liquor easy .
I realized that I get drunk on liquor easily. [ The word " easy " is not a grammatically correct option here. Alternative : I realized that I have a low tolerance for alcohol. ]
But I have to go to my university .
Do you use these words in your daily life ?
I guess the best way to polish my English is to stay in countries whose mother tongue is English .
However , I ca n't afford to study abroad because my money and time are severely limited. ( It could go either way )
How do you do ? [ This is actually not a very common greeting any more. " Hello " and " How are you " are much more common. ]
Today I am writing a diary entry in English for the first time in my life .
I feel a little tense .
I have a part-time job , and helped my grandfather this morning .
He is a farmer , so I did various things necessary for growing vegetables .
" Fate " can be translated as " 運 命 " in Japanese , and " destiny " can also be translated by the same word .
I know there are several English words equivalent to " 運 命 "
I work at a Chinese restaurant now where I help with the cooking .
Or " I need to memorize too many dishes ( menus ) . "
It 's beyond my capacity. ( -_- ; )
I 'm specializing in social welfare , but recently I have lost an interest in it .
Which path to choose is very important , so it 's a very difficult choice for me .
sado ( " the way of tea " ) 茶 道 ( " The Way of Tea " )
sado ( 茶 道 , " the way of tea " ) ( " The Way of Tea " )
" time for relaxation " " Time for relaxation "
I was not interested in the way of tea before ( I started there ) .
I want to begin a lesson again though recently I took a rest. I want to start learning about it again even though I have recently taken a break .
The lesson is not over throughout the life. You can learn about it throughout your life

He will quit his job at our office at the end of March .
He is one of the targets ( victims ) of corporate restructuring. I would use the word " victim " more than " target " because it gives more the connotation of your friend having bad luck befall him .
He is leaving for another job .
He and I have been at the same group for about five years , since 2005 .
He was our group leader .
Therefore , I was shocked and felt somewhat betrayed when I heard the news of his change of job .
To tell the truth , I was sorry I did n't think he was enough of a leader of our group , so I often argued with him about his management. ( " To tell the truth " is a common expression )
But it is also true that I respect him a lot as a good engineer and I like him as a good elder friend .
Anyway , we will miss him .
We wish for his success in his new job as well as good luck with his health. I added " good luck " with his health because one ca n't really wish for success for health. You would , however , be able to wish for success in an operation that would make someone healthy .
Usually , one would use " Best wishes to him. " For example , on Christmas cards , you can sometimes see the sentence " Best wishes to you and your family.. "

Gave the lawn some fertilizer
First , about 10 gram ｓ of urea fertilizer , which is two or three scoops using a tablespoon , was dissolved and diluted into 5 liters of water in a watering pot .
And the dilute solution of fertilizer was given to the lawn , 2 to 3 liters per square meters .
This urea fertilizer is very efficient for the growth of the grass , and is especially good for making the leaves green .

I ran in a marathon yesterday as described in yesterday 's journal .
That was my last race of 2009. // That was my last race of the year .
I participated in just 30 races this year !
Am I a race freak , a race dependent , or something like that ?
I myself think I am a running freak , maybe I 'm dependent on running to some extent .
By the way , I do n't like racing against other people very much .
I like running slowly as well as jogging better while thinking various things alone without having to think about anything .
When I am running , I can have my own time to myself .
It probably means we will feel challenged during the 42.195 km , , but it is very short time compared with one 's whole life , so it is short enough to bear it , or it is too short to enjoy .
This marathon race is the Kintarou Marathon .
It will be held on May 16th .
We have a 2km race for kids , as well as 5km , 10km and 15km races .
The total of entrants was more than 2800 last year .
We went over the outline today and checked the marathon course by walking the actual course .
The total distance was about 10km .
I ran at an easy pace and it felt good .

My kids are back from their short trip
This is a story fromsome days ago. My two children , a son and a daughter , went on a short trip to Fukuoka during their spring holiday .
They went to Haneda Airport by train and to Hakata International Airport in Fukuoka by air , by themselves .

My nephews also loved to meet and play with them .
My children loved the castle very much and sent me its photo via cell phone email .

In the summer , we have a lot of firework festivals in Japan .
We Japanese love to go out and watch firework shows while wearing Yukatas , which are the traditional summer clothes of Japan .
Yukatas are a kind of Kimono .
Women and girls ( like to/tend to ) go out wearing Yukatas in/during summer , nowadays , for example , to go summer festivals or something like that .
Men and boys rarely go out in Yukatas .
We men wear Yuaktas mostly when at a Japanese style inn , after taking a bath in/after bathing in a hot spring .

If you communicate with someone , you share and exchange information with them .
I think mutual communication is much better than the one-way communication .
Mutual communication would bring us many things such as mutual understanding , happy feelings , smiles , love , new ideas , and something better like that than one-way communication do. ( Things you could not get through one-way communication )
If you want to mutually communicate with someone , you can start by saying hello with warm smile to them at first .
On this site , writing an entry , making a correction or leaving a comment , replying to a comment or leaving another correction on their entry is a kind of great mutual communication .
I did not reply to all of your corrections and comments on lang8 .
I always appreciate it .

Even though your sentence seems correct , the sentence structure is something a Japanese native may say. I think you should use this alternative as an example how to properly set up a sentence.Ex : Even though the recent recession has hit us hard , we should try and work harder so we can recover our economy this year. ( Hopefully this year. )
Regardless of the recent depression , no , because of the depression , we should work harder and harder to make the economic recovery .

We have been studying about some research and development strategies since last spring .
I was surprised to have found that one of the members was an alumni of my high school !
He was an alumni who was 4 years my senior .

It is very rare to meet alumni in Kanagawa or Tokyo , which are in the Kanto area , because my high school is in Hiroshima .

I ran the day before yesterday for about 4 and a half hours .
I do n't think I ran at a slow enough pace for LSD.. .

I now have two problems regarding internet shopping .
These are some sort of delivery errors , I guess .
First , the replacement of a faulty watch which I bought on eBay have n't arrived yet .
The replacement seems to have got lost somewhere . -- if you wanted to emphasise that it could be anywhere , I 'd say ... " somewhere in the world "
I contacted the seller but.... -- but... what ?
Finally , there was also coffee , which is ordered through an internet coffee shop I used constantly , seems to have been lost too .
What on earth is happening around me ?
I hope they will be delivered soon .

A Fulfilling Week Since you 're describing your week , you should use the adjective " fulfilling "
I suggest : I felt fulfilled this week .
First , I was busy on the job , where I have a lot of tasks to do. Also possible : First , I was busy with my job , for which I have many tasks to do .
For example , I had some meetings with ( someone at first time ) , gave a presentation to new employees concerning our section and made some important decisions regarding our research. I 'm not quite sure what you mean with " someone at first time. " Do you mean " I had some meetings with certain people for the first time " ?

Niigata is located by the Sea of Japan side .
I saw a lot of piled snow there .
It seems hard to spend a winter with such an amount of snow .
It had not been snowing in Niigata , but it snowed a lot in Tokyo yesterday evening , as the super express train back home was delayed by the snow .
We rarely have so much snow in the Tokyo area , so we are not used to this weather .
Therefore such snow somewhat affects our life , such as the train delays , for example .
The entry phone of our house rang , but no one was at the door .
The front entrance intercom rang , but no one was there .
It has happened twice this week .

It ca n't be anything supernatural or spiritual

Have you ever heard ( of ) the word " Syu-Ha-Ri " ?
At the beginning of studying something , we need to keep to the teaching of our seniors .
At the next step , we break the principle and make some alterations to it. ( I changed this because " principle " is singular but " them " is plural. You could also say .. " we break the principles and make some alterations to them. " )
It is good to learn /for learning .
Next , we separate from the teaching ( altogether ) and make our own way .

We walked through an old abandoned tunnel , where we did n't exactly know where we were .
In the tunnel , we felt something was standing behind us , but we could not turn around because we were afraid .
I think it was something spiritual .
Cleaning our house
Yesterday , my wife and I cleaned our house. ( You would say " clean up the mess " but for more specific phrases use " cleaned the house or " cleaned my room , etc. "
We cleaned all the rooms , dusted , wiped windows , vacuumed , threw away some old books and knickknacks , washed the screen doors , and so on , taking care to clean everything thoroughly .
At the very least , we cleaned more rigorously than usual .
The weather was mild that we had fun cleaning and were a bit exhausted .
Thanks for the get-well messages
I do n't have any words to say thank you. Or : " I do n't have the words to thank you "
I think I can run now , but it 's raining outdoors , unfortunately .

I ran two races in a roll , a 10km race on Saturday and a 1/2 marathon on Sunday .
This is one of a series of monthly marathons held on every second Saturday .
It is because I have a half marathon the next day .
It is named after Sontoku Ninomiya who is known in Japanese history as one of the great people who contributed to agricultural revolutions in Japan about 300 years ago .
It was a beautiful sunny day , So I felt great while running .
But my competitive personality did n't let me keep running slowly after other runners .
Less smile but more serious look on my face .
This was equal to my own record at this marathon .
I was totally exhausted by these two races on two consecutive days .
I had a meeting with the director of laboratory , who is my main boss , alone yesterday .
The meeting was held before the start of the business day .
It was because he was busy all day except during that time. ( This sounds more natural )
That was the first time we talked alone without my immediate boss , so I was somewhat nervous before the meeting .
We had a very fruitful discussion about my project .

The surface of the paved road felt harder than usual under my shoes
My hands were so cold that I could not write nor type well .
Morning glow was very beautiful because of the clear air .

Enough water and electrolytes will help prevent suffering from the heat .
Take care and enjoy summer as much as possible .

I have just gotten though my three years of " Yakudoshi. "
The method of measurement is called " Kazoe-toshi. "
This time my Yakudoshi is from the ages of 41 to 43 , from Mae-yaku to Ato-yaku .
It finished the day before yesterday , which was my 43rd birthday .
I did n't experience any misfortunes or illnesses during my Yaku-doshi years .
This is a Japanese belief that people at the ages of yakudoshi are likely to experience misfortunes or illnesses .

We had a welcome party for me yesterday night. [ You could also say , " last night. " ]
I moved to another department in my office on April 16th .
My new coworkers held the party to welcome me .
Younger coworkers are in the new department , so the party was more cheerful than my old department .
There was a unique menu item at the bar .
It was deep fried ginger .
Have you ever eaten this ?
I ate this for the first time .
It was more delicious than expected .
We had a couple of very happy times at the bar while chatting casually since we had known each other for some time .
I was very happy to be welcomed and felt grateful .

It is dizzyingly hot .
In the city , there is a heat island phenomena .
A hot wind is blowing instead of the cozy cool wind .
Have you ever felt a loss of motivation after completing a big goal ?
It is weird that I do n't think I can keep my motivation high after completing my goal of running my first ultra marathon two weeks ago. ( Original sentence was a little awkward , so I 've simplified it. )
I do n't want to run as much as before .
Perhaps I might have burnt-out or something like that .
Have you ever felt like this yourself ?
I read a similar story in a book by Haruki Murakami .
It might be because of the physical fatigue , including the visceral fatigue .
( I don ' think " The instinct " is appropriate here ) This might force me to take a rest so my whole body can recover .
Anyway , It was a very interesting experience. ( If you are referring to the ultra-marathon was should be used. If you are referring to the experience of losing your motivation , continue to use is. )
I will take a good rest for some time so my body can recover and so that I can enjoy running again .
There is just a month left till ( until ) the end of this year .

We had work last Saturday , so we have a rest day today in its place .
To tell you the truth , some of the power cuts were canceled by reducing electricity consumption .
I think we will have them until at least the spring or the summer .
We will have an irregular and stressful life cycle for a while to help Japan recover quickly .
What we can do ourselves right now is what we have to do to help Japan recover. .

April Fools'

Anyway , I still live honestly .
What I mentioned above is not a lie , I am sure .

I have one today , but , unfortunately , it is raining now .
On the way home , I was nearly run over by a car yesterday evening .
Yesterday evening , on the way home I was nearly run over by a car

The team belongs to the Kanagawa prefecture amateur senior soccer league .
At the senior league , only players aged above 40 can play .
At the annual meeting , we discussed last year 's activities , including the game results and the budget and made plans for the coming year , while talking about old and new staff , ways of management , game tactics and so on .
The meeting was held in a party room at an Izakaya for about an hour with no drinking. It was surprising for us .
It was a very worthwhile meeting .
And thereafter , we started partying and drank .
It was great fun .
We drank very much and enjoyed talking about our soccer and also something else .
I wonder why athletes drink so much .
At least many athletes whom I know of , do so .

Electric fans do great job and play a great role during this season and come summertime .
However , the rainy season here in Kanagawa , Japan will be finished in a few days .
I think it will ( end/be ) next week .
I love summer of course , but this summer I am worrying about saving electricity .
Less light is rather good , but less air conditioning is not good especially for weak people , for example , the old , the baby and the sick .
It 's said that the good fortune will be gone if you speak .
I spent time watching some dramas and movies recorded on the HDD recorder .
I watched " 500 days of summer " and " Solanine " which is a Japanese movie , and some other stuff , too. [ ← Casual expression. Here , it seems more natural. ]
I did not do any housework and refreshed myself by thoroughly lazy resting .
I 've probably completely refreshed myself now .
These days , I have been returfing the lawn in the garden. Repairing is okay as well , however " returfing " is more exact because it specifically means applying new turf to the ground .
It was a kind of cooler climate lawn for the autumn and winter seasons .
I have been repairing it / returfing it with another kind of hotter climate lawn for the summer .
It grows much faster in this hot summer .
I shall tell you how I repaired the lawn .
Well , now I will get started .
First , cut about 5 cm off the summer-kind blades , and second , put them into holes dug in the garden. ( We usually say " a blade of grass " and not " a straw of grass " ) .
And then , water the grass every afternoon .
Several days later , almost all the blades will take root and grow .
There 's no need to pay more money .
Why do n't you try it ? Or : Why do n't you try also ?
It is a kind of fire festival to worship travelers ' guardian deities which are called 'Doso-jin' .
It is held here and there in rural areas of Japan on the little New Year ( January 15th or during 14th and 16th by the lunar calendar ) . -- " little New Year " ? I have n't heard of that .
It is said that we can avoid disease if we eat rice cakes baked in the fire , and we can improve calligraphy skill if the fire rises high .
Three consecutive days off
Tomorrow is a national holiday in Japan. We call this holiday , Coming of Age Day. There is not really anything wrong with what you wrote but I made some changes to try to make it flow better and to make it more native-sounding .
Tomorrow is Coming of Age Day in Japan , and it is a national holiday .
So we have three consecutive days off . ( consecutive = in a row )
So we have three consecutive days off .
I am enjoying the days off just after the beginning of the new year .
I am enjoying the rest just after the beginning of the new year .
I ca n't wait .

Difficulty of making timely corrections on journals
I think it is difficult to make corrections on others ' journals in a timely manner .
I want to make corrections and comments on journals to help others in their study of languages and ( also ) to make friends .
Whenever I want to do so , someone has already made corrections on them .
I do n't think it is good to make the same corrections again , so I am sorry but I can not make additional corrections .
It 's almost like a kind of competition .
It is surely difficult to make an original and timely correction on someone 's journal .
Have you ever felt these difficulties as I have ?
It is based on the novel originally written by Kanae Minato .
It 's a revenge story about a junior high school teacher whose daughter was killed by his pupils .
The story consists mainly of the confessions of some characters. ( " Consists mainly of... " is the usual word order ) .
She , who is a teacher , a mother and an avenger , plots revenge on the killers in a terrible , psychological way. ( I do n't think " revenger " is that common of a word. People usually use " avenger " ) .
It was a horrible , unhappy story .
No one came out happy , not even the avenger mother and the killers ( upon whom revenge was sought ) .
One killer , who is a junior high school student , has his own story of why he killed a little girl .
The other killer , who is a classmate , has another story .
I do n't recommend the movie to everyone / all peoples , especially not to parents who have school kids .
However , it may make you wonder about whether or not the school life of your kids is okay. ( I 'm not quite sure if this is what you meant ? )
You say that it was non-fiction , but add the words " It was only a non-fiction story , " so I 'm a bit confused as to whether you meant that it was actually a fictional story ? ?
I hope a story like this one will not happen in the real world .
Nevertheless , I enjoyed the movie .
Do you like movies of this kind ?
It was excellent weather for running a marathon .
Fuji which is now capped with snow , and the other mountains coloured various colours of the fall leaves. In Canada , England , Australia ( and other Commonwealth countries ) , " colours " is spelt with a " u. " However , the way you have it is also correct ( American English ) .
The 1st half of this race , I ran far but too fast .
This caused me to slow down for the 2nd half .
I got a stomach muscle spasm around the 25th kilometre .
It was a little painful to run .
I think it was the toughest one this year .
What are you planning to do this weekend ?

...but needless to say , I will be moving much slower than a race car. .
but needless to say , at a much slower pace than a racing car .
Spain beat Netherlands 1-0 in extra time .
It was a very exciting game filled with many amazing plays at the highest level .
I am looking forward to the next one even though the current one has only just finished .
I make it a rule to do some routines during the new year 's holidays .
On the first day , I ran to the top of a mountain nearby to see the first sunrise with friends .
Then , I walked up to the temple to wish for a nice year with my family .
On the second day , we visited my wife 's parents for New Year 's greeting .
And we went to cheer at the Hakone Ekiden Relay Race .
We also went to watch the High School Soccer Championship games at the stadium. Using " and then " is very repetitive .
And then , we went shopping at Yokohama midtown .
On the third day , I ran to cheer the Hakone Race again , but this time , alone .
I have somewhat busy holidays .
Note/Write everything down in notebooks/in a notebook
We always think of various things. It is just simpler to use " various things " or " many things. "
Coming up with good ideas , pondering by myself , thinking of the right words or phrases , and so on .
It 's a pity that we can not keep all of them in our mind or that we can not remember what good ideas we thought up just a while ago. Also possible : ... " what good ideas we came up with just a while ago. "
It 's a pity that we can not remember them all , even the ones we just thought of
We forget most things because our brains do n't have infinite capacities to remember everything. Also possible : We forget most things because our brain does n't have the infinite capacity to remember everything .
Yes , it probably is. Or , at least for me , it certainly is .
Do n't you think it would be good if we could remember every good idea we had thought of ? Also possible : Do n't you think it would be good if we could remember every good idea we ever thought of ?
What should we do to attain that ? Or : How can we accomplish that ?
What we should do is note everything down on notebooks .
Bringing a notebook with us at all times , we can note down anything we see , hear and feel. We can also note down good ideas , even bad ones - everything. Also possible : We can also note down ideas , good or not - in essence we can note down everything .
Or : carrying a notebook all the time , we can write down everything we feel , see , hear , the good ideas , the bad ideas , everything .
Fortunately , notebooks are not so ( can also replace " so " with " very " ) expensive , easy to get at stationary shops , convenience stores , and so on .
By itself , I do n't really understand this sentence. However , I think that you have already conveyed the meaning of this phrase in the next two sentences .
When we fill up a notebook , we can just use a new one .
When we fill up a notebook , we can just useanother one/start a new one .
We can write everything on them and then we can forget everything we had noted down .
That is a good idea , do n't you think ?

This river is famous for sweetfish fishing .
They fish using a decoy in the center of the river and with the water at waist level with very long fishing rods .
I had a bit of trouble understanding your sentence , so I tried correcting according to what I understood : The decoy fish are put into the territory of the targeted sweetfish , so that the targeted sweetfish will attack the decoy and be hooked .
As much as I know , that is the way of fishing for sweetfish using a decoy .
I have never fished for sweetfish with/using a decoy .
Fishers with their very long rods in the river is a beautiful scenery in/during the summer .

Excursion with my son
My son and I took the same train to commute to work yesterday morning .
I went to the head office of my company in central Tokyo for a business meeting .
My son went to his university after getting off our train .
There were not enough seats for both of us. There was only one .
The train was getting crowded more and more as it edged closer to central Tokyo .
He got off at Shimokitazawa Station and transferred to his train to school .
I also transferred to a different at the next station. The new train headed towards my compay 's head office .
It was only one event in our schedules that day .

The next time I ran was at lunchtime .
I was sorry I ran with my itchy and runny nose , but it was during the warm spring daytime. It is strange to say that you are " sorry " unless you are apologizing for something or to someone directly .
I did n't want to go back to the office.. .
And the third time I ran was when I took a long detour from work back home .
Yesterday was the no overtime at my office .
So I left my office as soon as possible to run to see the cherry blossoms at dusk .
We have spent a long time very happily together .
It 's hard for me to say to my wife that I love her , but I do love her. ( Just a bit more natural this way. )
Some years ago , she completely forgot that today was our anniversary day. ( Because you have said 'some years ago ' , you can then say 'today ' and mean 'this day , some years ago ' )
I love that side of her , too .
I found two big male Japanese pheasants on the riverbank path on the way to work yesterday .
They looked about two feet long from head to tail. ( Often when talking about amounts , you include " long , " " tall , " etc. For example : " The river is 20 feet wide , " " I am 6 feet tall , " " He is 60 years old/young , " etc,. )
They had beautiful red heads and long tails .
There are many kinds of wild birds around the riverbank on which I run as a home course. ( ? Not sure what you mean by " home course. " )
Different kinds of herons , geese , and so on ; I do n't know their names .
I enjoy watching them while running .

That happened yesterday during the game between Germany and England .
The ball shot by a striker hit the crossbar and bounced into the goal once and then bounced back outside to the goal keeper .
However , the referee did n't see the goal .
Referees at the world level seldom make a mistake , but unfortunately , it still happens .
It makes things interesting and exciting .
Interestingly , in a game in 1966 between the same two countries , the referee disallowed a legitimate goal .
This has been called a " suspicious goal. "
The play with with the disallowed goal from yesterday 's game will be called a " suspicious non-goal , " from now on , I think .
