It 's been getting colder these days here in Japan .
The summer weather in Japan is not agreeable to me with its high humidity and temperature .
So , as the winter is coming , I 'm getting to feel better .
It is the very exciting season .
But , before enjoying those kind of happy time , I have to do a kind of boring,
I have a fiancee and she is finding her job .
It seems not easy to find a job for women in Japan .
The first , most women have baby and they have to take maternity leave .
Employers do n't like it even if maternity leave is the right for employees .
The second , women workers likely to quit their job because of child care or the transfar of ther husbands .
If a woman worker quit her job , employers have to find a new employee .
Though there are many women workers who have excellent potentil , employers often hesitate to hire them .

I just learnt alphabet .
It 's said that because the Korean grammar is similar to the Japanese 's , so that the Korean who study Japanese just have to take about 1year to speak Japanese fluently , while the other foreigners have to take 3,4 years or more than so .
I found that the Korean 's alphabet is easier to write than the Japanese 's .
How about the way of spell ?
And after I entered the Japanese department , I even ca n't recall any English 's grammars that I 'd learnt before .
But it 's also said that it 's very difficult to learn well both of them .
One time , I had an Japanese examination .
The Japanese who see a katakana word just spell it normally but we who had learnt English before when see a katakana word , we just try to think of an English word and then spell it .

But in my university , at the second year of regular training , we can choose a second qualifications if we want and sure that we 'll be able to study well both .
My university has about 11 foreign language 's departments and some other department where teach economics , travel bussiness , computer and so on... If we 're learning a foreign language , we 're advised to choose the economics or travel bussiness 's department so that when we graduate we will have a best job .
So next year , I intend to choose English department for the second qualifications .
And when we 're at the third year , we have a compulsory subject .
It 's differ from the second qualifications .
Because the second qualifications also has economics , travel bussiness , computer... training and it is n't compulsory .
For example , I 'm learning Japanese , I have to choose one in 10 other foreign languages remained .
So , if next year I choose the English department , the year after I maybe choose Korean for second foreign language .
To learn almost Japanese , we have 4 years .
After that , it 's not sure that we can be able to speak it fluently .
It 's called " love 's language , " is n't it ?

Actually , my original name is not Don .
It is Dong Chun Kim that is called in Korea as my whole name .
As you feel my whole name is not as easy name to pronounce , so I have abbreviated it to Don .
Wanting their offspring to live following the meaning , what the name means is the first priority when Korean fathers give name to their sons .
If somebody asks me what makes me feel happy in my life , I would definitely respond that it is delicious foods that make me happy .
I love not only the flavor of it , but also the atmosphere when I have it with my friends .
While eating we also drink alcohol , chat and , of course , make joke .

When Sadako 's siblings were transferred to remote place , Sadako decided to become a nunenter a convent .
In Heian period , to kill oneself is forbidden , so people who want to died are supposed to be become a nunenter a convent .
But Sei-syonagon ,when a man of power propose her to serve another ,never to separate from Sadako .
Her loyalty is spirit modern Japanese lost .
In her essay ,she wrote only beautiful memories .
I do n't think so ,No .

I had to translate a poem , 'Lines Left upon a Seat in a Yew Tree ' by Wordsworth into Japanese .
I always struggle with the translation especially when it comes to the poetry .
English is a very useful language when you try to express your feeling because one word has a lot of meanings , but when you try to analyse a poetry or something , it 's so hard to find out what a word really means , I think .
I would like not to mention about my study anymore now .
I love both beer and wine , but recently beer does n't suit me.. .

If you read this , I 'm sorry my diary is not an intersting one , but I would like to reccomend you the bottle of wine about which I mentioned above .

Trip to Hongkong
In fact my wife comes from Hong Kong .
We are visiting her hometown in years .
In the beginning , I can enjoy western styles of foods like bread , cheese , and pizza , but after sometime , I started to miss Korean foods so much .
However , Korean foods were quite expensive and it is hard to find Korean restaurants .
I think a lot of foreign people are facing similar difficulties in Korea if they come from some small countries .
They have something like congee , a lot of noodles , and many sea oriented foods .
I still remember a course of 12 dishes we had at the banquet in Hong Kong .
I started to study English in my first year of the middle school .
It was a lot late compared with students these days .
As I know , they start to learn English much earlier age even from the pre-school or kindergarten .
That may be the reason my conversation skill is not as good as my reading and writing skills .
I think any language should be acquired in one 's early age at least before 10 years old ; otherwise , it would be a difficult task for him to speak the language fluently as native speakers do .
Hopefully , I can improve my English writing skill and help other people 's Korean writing... .
The ritual came from the Confucianism .
We have grown up reading some Chinese novels like " Sam-Kuk-Ji , " and " Seo-U-Ki. " Even some old people were very proud of saying they read the book series for several times .
Some people have thought Chinese have a bigger body than Korean because we are in different ethnic groups .
Around 10 years ago , I could have the first chance to meet Chinese , first , people from Taiwan and then main land China .
They spoke a language I could never understand , which made me so wonder how people from two nations were able to communicate for several thousand years and how so many cultures could be transferred between two countries .
Frankly , I got impression that they were poor and little tiny but I started to enjoy their food especially ones from " Schezan " area .
Sometimes it needs to speak English .
And nowadays we have many guests from overseas especially China & Korea .
So I started to learn Korean , but it is difficult for me .
I will try to write diary in Korean someday .

The earthquake forcast ,2011,3,14 .
Please laugh at me with saying fool .
I made a conclusion about the relation between the earthquqke and planet location .
The last year I wrote ( I may have delate it. ) the figures about grobal potential energy .
I reserched the relation but I could'nt find
the exact frequency about between figures and earthquake .
Beacause the exception ,most biggest Smatora Ireland M9.3 , was itself but I ca n't find relation .
The last year I wondered that as for the " Big " earthquake happen at
after highest or lowest of this figure .
But I can not exactly trust this even till now .
But the Big earthquake in 2010 ,and like Kobe ,and so on ,happenedly occared at within one month before or later .
I have already reserched it .
As sentences may become so long ,the following is my conclusion .
① When universal grobal potential energy was around highest or lowest ,the earthquake energy may has thendency that it becomes big .
② As for the seabed fault ( = slit ) ,which is compensately vertical against mass cerculation ( ? ) ,moves ( Aassume ) .
③ Date has some tendency ,but it is difficult to find. ( becomes too many daies /per around it )
※ ② is suspecious .
※ About ① ,a few exception can not be found by this method .
Please be your refference ( s ) .
I thank for your reading .

Waiting him is what she hates the most .
She looks again the old clock .
The silence is surrounding her and she can help trembling while thinks about him .
The living-room is cold , so is she .
Her voice is a whisper that disappears into the living-room like a dream does when the night is over .
She can stand it anymore and turn on the tv and her eyes got fixed on the screen .
Breathless , she finally arrives there to find him putting his shoes off and she 's unable to control herself and holds him so tight that he can breathe .
Smiling , the boy kisses her head and pulls her away softy " It 's late , you should be sleeping , no waiting for me " he says tenderly " You know I wo n't be sleeping until you 'll be here " Narrowing his eyes , the boy walks through the corridor until he realizes the TV is still on .
In silence , he crosses the door and his eyes glues on the screen .
There , he holds her tight making her smile .
" Now you 're here I can sleep "

I am an extremely positive soul now , alot has changed , alot has happened , alot has made me realise where id been going wrong for a very long time .
i feel my life is alot more forfilling and just generally better .
I love growing and learning , there is no better feeling then being able to look at yourself , at how you were , and how you are now , and the positive changes you are able to impliment upon yourself through time and experience .
No matter how society changes , there are things which have n't changed through times ; sense of following rules , morality , public mind , consideration towards others,a mind of human rights , the awe to things which have powers beyond human and love for our hometown 's nature and culture .

① Although it 's gradual , various trials which seek out a form of education have begun in schools of each area .
If the ideas or devices of teachers and lecturers accord with the expectations from children and parents , these trials must have good effects .
At first , I suggest it is important to let children study what to learn , how to think and how to express .
Looking back on this 30 years , I can not but be surprised at intensive changes of the suburbs of Tokyo .
You can not see the reminiscence of old fields unless you go far from the central of the city .
For our country , it 's extremely important to increase mutual understandings between nations through international exchange and advertising activities in each field and is also important to build friendly relationships based on mutual trust .

i could not did my best as I was so nervous and it was partly because I realized that I was not so serious. .
The reason why I said i was n't serious about taking tests is that I did n't have a specific goal for my future .
It 's kinda like , I felt I had been forced to do anything .
It 's been a big problem to me for a long time .
today when I was studying English , I realized that I was n't eligible to become a teacher because I did n't know of good conversations .
I think I 'm not qualified to become a teacher unless I enjoy conversations .
If you do n't have communication skill , you should n't teach .
As I realized above conclusion this afternoon , I went to a church where I hung out a lot .
There I decided to talk what I have in mind more positively .
Next time , I 'm going to talk to a person who has been attractive for me. .
There are something troublesome for foreigners who are going to live in Japan , one of which is a trouble because of not being good at Japanese .

Today in kobe city , we have an annual big event , Fire works Festival ! !
So I am going to wear a yukata , which is a traditional Japanese clothes for summer .
It is need to create person who can say his or her opinion , which is not borrowed from others , toward outside in English , ( り っ ぱ に ? ? ) ,person who can explain the situation which is peculiar to Japan and convince someone .
Even if a teacher have a higher skill of teaching , it might often not do well if there is no connection between a teacher and students ' mind .
In order that teacher 's skillful questions and feedback are to be welcomed by children , mutual trust must be needed as a first step .
Family plays a very important role in the sound growth of juveniles .
Parents centered family , members of which help each other , helps to foster a considerate mind towards family in child 's heart .
According to my experience , the possibility is very low that something you had saved before as you thought it would be useful afterward is actually useful .
The reason why we make something tidy is because we reuse it afterward .

I really want to get to know and make good relationship with them .
However , I feek so isolated that neither I can open my heart nor relax myself .
I know I should interact with ALTs and improve my English , but I 'm so tired to the extent that I am not able to communicate smoothly .
So I have decided to wake up more earlier and take some exercise .
It is said that taking some exercise in the morning make us heathier .

I 've just begun teaching at high school .
I am having fun at school ! !
Students are so nice and obedient , which is very good to me because I am a beginner .
But there aren 's always good things. .
Firstly , students are very very good at English because this school is well known for its high sophisticated English education .
So it 's hard for me to teach them as some of them are even better than me .
There are some students who grew up overseas .
In terms of speaking , I am inferior to them .

I also often use the application conveniently , although , I have a big problem with using the software when translating Japanese material into English one .
I often translate Power Point documents in Japanese into English .
Mistakes in a translation are n't of problems because it 's checked by a senior of mine at the end of the translation .
Kanji shows many meaning by a word .
Kanji shows many meaning by a word .
Speaking to a example which I encountered today , I dealt with " 法 令 対 応 範 囲 . " ( 6 words ) It means " scope for the enforcement by Japanese law. " But if I try to enter the phrase in small box on a sheet of a Power Point document , the phrase can be entered with only small fonts which would n't be seen by remote audience when having a presentation .

As you may know , the Japanese calender has the " Golden week " which is combination of national holidays in early May .
But I do n't like this system on which the government place many national holidays and make up consecutive holidays .
Since everybody have to get off at the same time , almost all of places where people will go , such as any amusement parks , zoos , theaters , the roads people will get there and so on , would be hardly crowded .
Although Japanese labor system has the same system of the " holiday of pay " applied to many foreign countries which everybody can take it at will , willingly Japanese workers wo n't get it supposedly because Japanese has assiduity basically and does n't go for acting alone such as getting a holiday with pay while co-workers works .
I think this is so inefficient that We should decrease national holidays and make getting a certain number of holidays with pay obligatory .
It 's the center of the Golden week right now , but unlike such situation , I 'm working at office as usual !
This is the first diary in this site .
I 've been to London UK last year for 2 month to learn English .
I have only few opportunity to communicate with foreign people in English , so I think I must find or make opportunity to communicate with anyone who can use English .

A mind for cherry blossoms in Japanese
I think there must be nobody of Japanese who dislike cherry blossoms .
As you can find in pictures above , in this season we have a field party under cherry trees seeing the blossoms opening up on the trees or flying off .
One week ago , I also went to a park with my wife and daughter to where it took 30 minutes by car from my home .
One week ago , I also went to a park with my wife and daughter to where it took 30 minutes by car from my home .
I was very happy to see just starting the blossoms ' to fall off from the branches , as if cherry blossoms are April showers .
Especially Japanese people are fascinated by falling cherry blossoms .
Medieval Japanese fighter 'Bushi ' would have hoped to die with dignity and beauty like falling cherry blossoms during battles .

As a matter of course , we have n't thought so , but I think the consideration for the 'cherry blossom ' is one of precious inheriting and to inherit cultures in Japanese .

Do you know the captioned phrase ?
As it may be known in only Japan , it 's a national campaign against increasing of CO2 emission .
If you want to know more information , please read the following site .
thorough recycle of wastes generated on our business operation
Although I think I 'm proud of our company 's actions and also individually try to do them for voluntary , recently our office is so hot that I ca n't get out my paper fan , which is called " 団 扇 " in Japanese and harness only my own power , due to a energy cut for artificial coolings .
Sometimes the hotness make me thinking that we reduce of our working efficiency by 6 % while we reduce of CO2 emission by 6 % !
I 'm writing a notification which informs managers of our subsidiary companies of a schedule for submission of some documents to our office .
Firstly I wrote Japanese version and now I 'm trying to translate it to English .
But I think it 's difficult due to an ambiguity of Japanese .
As you may know , English word order is very strict and subjects in English play very important rolls , which are not usually omitted , I think .
I was often said by my co-worker who is good at writting English that foreign people would n't be able to understand my text when I asked him of scanning through it after translating Japanese to English .

To be honnest,I want to go for a master degree in psycology,about which I dreamt at high school .

In my opinion,it 's natural for us to make mistakes in making choices,and it 's never late to let us go to the right way .
But it 's seemed they do n't really like this idea because they believe I should make use of my English skill to make a live as long as I 've studied abroad .
But I also believe my experience in England is valuable not only for my job,but also my life .
I know that I should go my way,but I just do n't want to make them disappointed od sad by my choice... .

i wentn to around city for shoping on boxing day .
i 've bought bag some cosmetics some clothes etc. .
All the birthday gifts I have received were few and normal .
Maybe , to other people , there were no any special features in those presents .
However , I thought whether a present is special or not depends on your own mind rather than other people 's opinion .
Contrast to other gifts , it was the most simple and cheapest one , but it was also my favorite one .
Different from those pencil boxes we can see in the bookstore , it was not made of textile but plastic .
Compared with those colorful and delicate designed stationary is its simple white-black color matching and square shape .
My friends usually praise my box for its cute pattern different from those monotonous logos on other pencil boxes .
What a delight for me is that everybody likes the pencil box so mush and wants to buy a same one for themselves .
Nevertheless , the reason why I like the present so much is not the pattern , the color or the shape , but the benediction contained in the gift .
What touched me deeply was that my classmate carved some notes with best wishes in the pencil box for me .
Come on,come on..... .
Athough,english is very difficult for me .

The Russo-Japanese War started because Japan wanted to halt the spread of the Russian expansion into East Asia .
This was what Japan feared the most , because they regarded Korea and Manchuria as a buffer .
If an agreement was not made soon , there was going to be a war , and this worried all of Europe because Russia was allied with France and Germany , and Japan had signed a treaty with Great Britain .
Europe was worried that the war would spread around the world .
It 's not that anyone sought war in both countries , but no matter what happened it 's as if the war was supposed to happen .
Though these circumstances only came to be due to the old governments ' policies dating back almost half a century .
The following will explain in detail the events of the Russo-Japanese war and how Japan was conceived as an " easy " enemy , but came to be acknowledged as one of the greatest military powers in the world after the apparent victory during the Battle of the Sea of Japan .
My boyfriend had been a hot temper person , but he improvemented himself for staying by my side .
Yesterday , we discussed about a book " Stuffed and starved : market , power and the hidden battle for the world food system. "

I found his change , so I realized that my talking attitude had was too impatient .
" Whether I 'm wrong ? " I asked .
" No , I think you are anger when we talked about the wretched farmers , due to you are kindhearted. "
I feel he is gentle unlike before , and I am be deeply touched by him .
My friends usually call me my Chinese nickname " 白 , " means " white. "

During my career I have had several diverse jobs , all of them required to work in a team and to deal directly with public. ( Does n't it sound stupid or too , I do n't know , cumbersome ? ) I found my short-time but intensive work at Autotrade AG particularly valuable in teaching me the importance of ascertaining a variety of customers ' needs and providing clear and accurate information in response to those needs .

Yours faithfully,
my very first post here .
Have no idea what language should I use for Journal , my French is very poor yet , so everything I can say is something like " je m'apelle " or " j'habite " etc .
I really need a good motivation to use French only .
So , dear friends , please consider it " English entry. "
Of course , if you can call " nice " this year 's abnormal spring .
My favorite weather site promises real summer this week , we 'll see , we 'll see .
Tomorrow I hope to succeed with one business I really need to finish .
Finally I have all papers and documents for my " abroad-passport. "
I really do n't know how to call it in English since there 's no such term in rest of the world !
And here in Russia we 're still like in USSR : one passport for this country , another one for travelling abroad .
Really stupid .
Although I do n't know if I can use it soon , I do n't have spare money for any kind of far-distance trips and the situation with vacation is still unclear .
Whatever , at least I will have a possibility to travel .
To know I can go anywhere if I really need .
That somehow makes me feel better .
Couple of years ago I was very " international " girl , I had penpals from many countries , it was funny and interesting .
After that I created account in LiveJournal and became part of Russian community there .
And I 've lost everybody I was in touch with from my " international " part .
Really miss .
Even more , I started using Internet in 1999 and I started it from international part .
And the truth is Internet was the main thing that made me SPEAK English , me , who was learning in from early school years but could n't say a wold .
The main mistake of our school here in teaching languages is that any foreign language is taught as a subject .
As a subject that has nothing in common with you .
it 's pretty simple - any language is an instrument of communication .
So I believe that this Lang-8 space will bring back " International " part back to me .
Of course , i can post more or less personal blahblah things here , but I 'd love to be more useful for the rest of community .
For example , for those ones who 's studying Russian or just interested in Russian reality ?
I can do small tasks , for example , to write small articles about any subject you 'd love to know from Russian part , or maybe I can take pictures of special places/things etc .
Any ideas/whishes ?

When I was in senior high school , the only thing I want to achieve is to study in the National Taiwan University .
Is it very shortsighted right ?
But I really enjoy the time that I play the piano and learn English .

And promote my skill at playing the piano so that passing the examination .
Maybe I will understand something on the way .
I join a lot of activities , search many information from everywhere , read different books including periodical , magazine to find my life 's direction .
S Since this is not the competition in the exam , I do n't want to write the fake dream like I did before .

How to improve my English composition writing ~ ~ ~
Now , I 'm preparing for my one year study in America as a international student .
I try my best to sharpen all my ability to make progress on my English learning .

To be honest , it really was a big impact to me .
I have never known there was so many problems about my writing skill .
I ca n't use concrete and clear words to support my ideas and words usage is n't idiomatic .
Due to above these reasons , I decieded to try to improve my English writing by writing diaries every day .
Also , I would try to write two or three compostions and ask my teachers revise them every week .

Maybe its late to talk about this year 's Valentine 's Day , because the day was already passed .
But there were something interesting that I want to record .
That day I give a call to my parents to say happy Valentine 's Day .
My mom said she did not receive any gifts from my dad .
My Daddy is one of the traditional Chinese men .
He love my mom very much , but he never , or say rarely say " I love you " to my mom , at least never say it when I was there with them .
He prefer to cook a good dinner rather then say useless words or give useless flowers .
Same as most of Chinese Traditional men .
Most of whom are middle-aged .
I called dad , said that he could buy a pouch of shrimps and cooked them as a gift to mom !
Because in my hometown accents , " Shrimp " and " flower " have the same pronunciation , called " Hou. "
So this Valentine 's Day , my mom received " Hou " as a gift and she was very happy .
My dad also very happy because the " shrimps " not only show his true love to my mom at the special day , but also did not wasted even a cent .
I 've got a heave cold last week .
At first , my nose is running and I can not help sneezing .
Then one night , i felt my nose was totally stopping up , I could not breath at all !
I had very bad sleep these days because of the nose problem .
I can not get in sleep .
Even at last I get in sleep , my sleep was not deeply and I was easy to wake up .
Now my head is dizzy and my hearing is poor .
When people talk to me the voice is like 30 miles away from me .
It sense like a piece of paper covering my ear when I am hearing .
I hate to have cold .
My nose is still stopping up when i typing these words down .
This afternoon , i will take train to go to Suzhou From Shanghai .

They all have its own charactoristics .

Acturally i went to visit them for several time already .
When i get back home , i still thinking of those beautiful and graceful gardens , i even dreamed of them at night .
So i decided to visit them again .
That must be a very happy tour this time .
I am so happy to hear that one of my best friend will get married this October !
She said all the wedding preparation will do by her and her fiance .
Because in China , most parents will undertaking almost all wedding preparation instead of their children do .
Now my friend has 8 month to prepare stuffs until October .
So they will have very beautiful wedding photo associate with good landscape .
My friend also said that she will go to buy her wedding dress after May Day Holiday .
Because in China , MDH is a big holiday and almost every emploies will have 3-7 paid-holiday , that means people have free time to be invited to weddings or other big issues .
So many couples will choose MDH to celebravt their weddings .
That scause the price increasing of merchandise .
And after the MDH , the prices will reduce to the normal standard .
Hope she can found her own style !
And good luck to my friend .

wrote pictures
the watching movie makes me feel like writing the picture .
as soon as i went to buy ackechbook and pencil .
for the first i tryed to write sight looking a picture .
i really want to write as looking my garden but it was cold
when i show thatpicture for my grandmother,then she said " can you write cattle picture for me , i 'd like to use for letter .
do you understand why she said that things ?
becouse they have a costom to send letter at january 1st .
we generally write " happy new year " and picture of the twelve sings of the chinesed zodiac in letters .
the picture which i wrote is too big so she maybe will scan it with the computer .
i have thought writing peter rabit for a long time sometimes , so this time i was pleasure writing it .
i sorry not to be able to put picture on dialy .
i am writting daially first time .
yesterday i went to amusmentpark with my sister .
it takes thirty minuits to go there with using freeway .
if i through entrance by nine in the morning,it costs very cheaply .
i left home at eight thirty for that to do but i had to pay twice more money becouse we mistake choising correct enter of freeway .
as soon as we arrived at apartmantpark without accident .
first we enjoyed riding attraction that is selected by guiness book of world records .
it is most hirhest and speediest in the world .
we made pose to come out on the way .
we were good smile on photo .
so we wanted to buy photp but othere person was taking. .
they 're face looked not good. .
we abandoned buy photo and we promised to buy photo someday .
after that we take abath in the spa .
forexample hot bath , tepid water .
and sene is different .
i relaxed looking river and waterfall and bamboo .
recentry japanese garden instead of increase west garden .
so i think that we have to treasure japanese garden .
now my fathere is studing at tokyo .
when he come back,i want to go there again with my family .
we could make good memory .
At first , it seems like such a drawing not a letter .
So I felt difficulties even write the each letters .
But now , I can read the Hiragana and Katakana and use simple conversation .
Basic patterns of Korean letter .
The principles of Korean letters are quite simple ( except several exceptions ) , So if you master the patterns of Korean letters , you 'll be able to read most of Korean letters .
Listening to the Korean speaking as much as you can , and try to pronounce the words like the native speaker .
It 's difficult to pronounce the words naturally only by practicing the letter .
I think it 'll be helpful to listen to Korean TV programs as another person mentioned above .
The storybooks or fairy tales with tape or CD will be easier in the beginning .
Every languages are the combinations of each words and some rules in any case .
If you master Korean to some basic degree , you can write the diary in this site .
I also write the diary in English thesedays,and other foreign people 's corrections are really helpful to me .
Type in Chinese or Japanese is takes more time and complex .
I heard that the development of Korean IT industry is somewhat affected by the Korean input system. ( it 's one of the reasons why I thank for being Korean .
The first one is the admission .
Students who want to use this way have to take the GSAT ( General Scholastic Ability Test ) in each winter vacation .
If it goes smoothly , you can enter college earlier and have 2 ~ 3 more months summer vacation .
The second one is to take the DRT ( Department Required Test ) in each beginning of summer vacation .
Moreover , the DRT always puts focus on the most difficult parts of the courses , so most of the students rather give up courses of 3rd grade than take the DRT .
They only have to fill the departments they want to enter in the form on the website of UAC , and wait for the result according to their grades .
In other words , the grades make the decision .
I think that the first way is better because it make schools and parents help students to find their target of life earlier .
High school students in Taiwan must arrive school at 7 : 30 every day , and stay in school for 9 hours until 17 : 00 .
The admission will improve students ' motivation of learning , and it may convince parents to give their children more free time .
I exactly feel some pressure
Recently I am always think of the years when i was young,which was happy ,relaxing and there was no pressure .
I 'm looking forward the future .

The mutually beneficial concept that " I scratch your back , you scratch mine " is not only attractive but it works well in reality .
It is not because of money or a certain rewards , It is the good mind that motivates people to do something and it makes a community .

I bought some books today .
Do you know this book ?
There are many famous books in Japan .
I heard that the some foreigners are interested in Japanese Manga culture .
I think that the Manga is very interesting .
Because most Japanese tends to consider Manga to be juvenile books .
I guess football is the most popular sports in Europe .
I played football at the age of 9 to 14 .
When I was 12 years old , I was elected as a delegate player of the football team of the prefecture .
And then , we faced the Korean team as a international match .
It was very exciting game and this game is the best match ever .
After that the both teams , Japan and Korea eat lunch together .
We could n't understand the language which each other speaks but we had a lot of fun .
I love the series of the 007 and James Bond .
There are many actors who acted the James Bond .

One of this attractions is the weapons which Bond uses .
The most impressive item is the car which can be transparent .

This band is really cool , and the atmosphere of their songs are little different from the ELLEGARDEN 's that .
ELLEGRDEN is known as a rock ( punk ) band , and most of theri songs are up-tempo .
But in the Hiatus , the type of each songs are different .
Even though their songs are great , I hope ELLEGARDEN would restarted the activity .

I want to look around the traditional view and eat Philippines food .
I want to get friends with them and improve my English through the conversation .
Does it mean something " evil , " likely one of the biggest challenges of modern human history , one of the toughest problems humankind ever faced since it 's on a global scale , its sheer enormity and complexity .
And the Earth 's getting hotter and hotter means that the more and more solar energy is accumulating inside the Earth 's atmosphere .
I see , the most difficult is that they 're not concentrated enough , the energy is distributed throughout a certain area so it 's not as easy as collect a piece of coal or nuclear material and burn it up .
Why do they have to resolve the question about distributed energy by the size of the " power plants " e .
huge wind turbines... I wonder why it 's so hard to get those kinds of energy .
A typical question I often find out there is money .
Yes , indeed , the only guy appear to be enough of money and capability is the US .
And more its government can spend hundreds of billions of dollars to wage a war on some unlucky guys in the desert of the Middle East ( another glorious victory that hardly any other nation thinks they dare to do - overthrow a government with it military power ranks 4th in just a few weeks ) , but it feels reluctant to spend more money on serious scientific and technical project that possibility change the world .
I had heard about the novel and its author long long time ago , since I was a

International friendship football game of Japan vs Korea was held at Seoul yesterday .
At first half , Japanese attacked aggressively with short pass but Korean defended with their tough physical .
In contrast with first half , Korean possessed the ball most of all time at latter half and there were the conclusive situations to goal but Japanese defender kept no goal at the end .
Though it was a friendship match , both of teams did very excited game .
Since next world cup will held at Brasil in 2014 , I hope both of teams improve their technique and tactics till then and can get a game beyond the final 16 which was result of this year 's world cup game .
The typhoon No.14 is coming .
Now the typhoon No.14 is coming to Sendai .
Therefore the Chilling rain have been falling following yesterday .
Since my room of which rent costs inexpensive is cold , I am now in warm lab apart from 5 minutes walk from my room .
I do n't like cold rain because I am likely to get a cough easily .
Super saiyajin Goku owned by neighbor is looking at the dark outside anxious about coughing .
As my today 's challenge , I used relative pronoun , but it 's uncertain how to use.. .
I was surprised to know that she is Momoe Yamaguchi .
I know her name but I had thought she was just late 70 's old idol and sang popular songs on that time .
Her songs are not old even now , and the sounds are really rock'n roll .
During a search about her , the fact she finished her career when she was only 22 astounded me again .
I like her songs as one of the good rock music !
Yesterday , the AFC ( Asian Football Confederation ) championship semi final match between Japan and South Korea held in Qatar .
But they did .
During the game , Japan ran well and South Korea showed tough physical and good ability .
I did n't know members of South Korea well , but after kick off the match , I was surprised they are very tall and young .
They played very gentle , I want to clap and cheer them .
However there was the only one disappointing thing .
I thought referee got fouls easily than usual .
If there was nothing , we could watch more exciting dynamic match .
Anyway I 'm crossing my fingers that both teams can win next games .
The day before yesterday , we the lab member held the Imoni party .
Imoni party is a kind of the BBQ making the pot filled with aroid , Chinese cabbage , green onion , carrot , meat , and so on and mainly organized in Tohoku region which is located in northern part of Japan .
In autumn , a lot of smoke of the Imoni party can be seen every near river in Tohoku .
In my living town Sendai , the pot is dressed with miso and use pork .
The taste is like tonjiru which is one of the gorgeous miso soup with full of vegetables .
In the neighbor prefecture Yamagata , they use the soy souse as the main dressing material and use beef .
Sweetly and salty taste evoke the Sukiyaki .
Since next year I am going to go to the Kanto region , this time Imoni party might be the last time for me .
Imoni party was very enjoyable but that idea made me a little bit concern .
The picture was shot few years ago .
In beginning of May , I went to the western part of Japan for sightseeing .

I 'm Japanese and a graduate student of master 2nd degree .
I want to learn foreign languages especially English now .
Because I want to understand or just know about foreign culture !
Considering unknown foreign cultures makes me thrill .
Since English is spoked all over the world , if I can use English , I can communicate billions of people and know many countries .
I am going to write about Japanese university life mainly .
In Japan , there are tons of news mentioned recent difficulties for university students to hunt job .
Unfortunately , the rate of student who could get work till October in this fiscal year goes down to 58 % from 63 % of last year .
And there are a lot of controversies about what is the main problem .
There are a lot of work especially middle and small companies .
They only apply big famous companies .
If students learned their limitations well , they could get work. "
Other insist , " There are too many students than ever .
The amount of university students has been increasing , it 's double compare to 1990 .
Now , degree of undergraduate is less special than used to be. "
Most of their opinions are hard for students .
So , the students who are exhausted or getting angry for the job hunting took demonstration .
University is n't preparation facility for hunting job !
Japan is in the depression right now.. .
In these days , my eyes have been getting tired because I 've spent much time sitting in front of display .
I usually experiment in lab and analysis the data by computer .
When I feel being exhausted , seeing news of the world was my favorite way to rest .
It was good for my feeling but not for my eyes ( xx )

Science cafe
I am going to start the work from next year .
But I 'm already a little bit scared though I have n't started working and known about work well .
So I frequently imagine the past retirement years ( ^ ^ ; )
And I like cafe , too .
So I want to integrate science and cafe , and will name it science cafe .
I hope there are a lot of scientific stuffs , astrometric telescope , test tube with flowers , gas burner on the table , flask as a drink shaker , and vacuum tube amplifier for good music .
In holiday seasons , children come to play and study ... .
After the every imagination for a while , I disappoint remembering the debt for scholarship I 've ever lent .
If there were good application of the scientific devices for the cafe , I want to know .
It has past several weeks that I had post last diary .
During a recent few weeks , I had been practicing for the Ekiden meet organized by electrical faculty of the graduate university .
First , I will try to explain about Ekiden simply .
But the big difference between full marathon and Ekiden is running alone or not .
In Ekiden , runner equips a Tasuki which is like a towel bonding its edges as a baton .
To express the appearance of the Tasuki is very difficult : p
Each runner runs own course and gives the Tasuki to the next runner .
So we had the Ekiden meet at last Saturday .
2 years ago , we could get 5th prise and last year was 4th prise .
Since we had good freshman and practice , we could get 3th prise !
So , we could have the most enjoyable time in the Oden party after the Ekiden for recent 3years .
I hope junior colleagues would get the more good result in next year .
I 'm now watching Egypt demonstration on Web TV .

But suddenly she got anger and said " you want to say only bread is nice and my cook is n't good do n't you ? . "
He was surprised at her saying .
The other day , after the meal , he said to her " I had your meal deliciously. "
and then she got angered and said " you want to say my cook is bad and you managed to eat the meal deliciously for your effort. "
Following the day , he told me about it and told he does n't know what he should say .
Are those example just difference of thinking between men and women ?
or should he choose what he say carefully ?

Suddenly I slipped and fell , my left ankle sprained .

One friend said me " shall I take you home ? "
I said by courtesy " no , I can go home alone " ( OK ! !
at that time the other friend said to one friend
" dont care , she said she can go home alone "
Though I was really really painful so I couldnt think anything
but then I could think this. .
'Bitch ! ! ' : - ( I could certify our friendship ! ! !

I watched one movie to familiar with British English accent .
It 's teenage movie .
so , though its story is obvious , but handsome lead man made me happy : D
As I watched that movie about 4 ~ 5times , the OST is quite accustomed to hear .
The band 'The stiff dylans ' !
The man is a part of the band in movie , then they sang 2songs .
One is 'Ever fallen in love ' , the other is 'ultraviolet' .
Good looking TVstar is better , but for singer , having attractive voice is best important thing to me .
After watched that movie , I connected England site , because I couldnt find , download the band 's songs .
I found their songs more and one site where I can download variety songs .
Oops , actually , 'Ever fallen in love'isnt their song and there 's many version sang many singers .
I love the stiff dylans ' ver .
Before this movie , my favorite is 'mamma mia'OST .
Already as you know , all those things are ABBA 's famous songs .
Of course I had known their a few songs , but had done like very much .
However after watched 'mamma mia ' , I downloaded all songs , repeated and repeated again .
'the men who is better than flower ? 'OST is so nice too .
How powerful of the OST is !
My hero is patriots .
It was about second grade in elementary school when I thought about my hero at first .
One day , the teacher gave me a paper which ask a few things about me .
In this questions , there was this 'who do you respect ? ' .
So I started to think someone who is worthy to answer that question .
I thought up soneone .
He is King Seo-Jong .
He made Han-gul with scholars to help his nation .
At that time , we used chinese character .
We borrowed and create won law to mark .
But it was n't real our 's and there was lots of unlettered person yet .
After I determined him of my hero , He is my hero but unreal hero .
Time goes by , at high school , I liked the subject 'Korean morden history ' from the era Joseon to now .
Actually though I 'm not good at Korean history , I used to get good grade on korean morden history .
I do n't know you know that ( How can I revise this sentence more naturally ? ) korea was a colony of Japan .
There were many people who flattered Japan and when Japanese chased the patriots , some traitors helped Japanese .
The other side , there were so many patriots .
They resisted not just the forces also writting like poems , novels.. ( especially I like resistive poem )
They were not afraid of death , ro rather , some patriots sacrificed themselves for contry .
Can I do that if happen again ?
I really thanks to them and every ancestors who make efforts to protect our culture and Han-gul and so on .
One thing more , It 's too unpleasant to me that the descendants who is traiots ' are very wealthy , as they inherited many things which got by flattering Japanese .
But patriots ' descendants are really poor , as their father or grandfather gave-up their family to devote himself ( Usually men ) .
Then their family could n't afford to get education well , cause they also hard to just keep their daily meals .
I want to that they get more respects .
I , however , have grown up at Tokyo .
Everytime I come back to Tokyo and find th Tokyo Tower , I feel relaxed .
I work for a trading company which gets fossil fuel from Asian countries such as China and Indonesia , and sells them iron manufacturers , power plants , papermaking company , and so on .

I 'd like to briefly describe some of the chinese spring festival .

The mandarin is the language that many kinds of north nomads or minority nationality enter or invaded the Central Plains had been belonging to Han nationally in ancient Chinese , then imitate and try to speak to the ancient han nationality , then learning not too good , so became the so called mandarin .
So I think that those place with dialect of south of the Yangtze River is more like or close the sound of ancient Han nationality especially cantonese and inland Min dialects almost as the ancient han nationality .
Those explains Why Cantonese literature is so rich and diverse while Mandarin literature in China so poor and shallow ?
Maybe you want to know which animal year you belong to by Chinese 12 Animals year or Chinese 12 zodiac .

Today,my brother and I helped my mother make mandarin juice .
But,We had to use many mandarins to make it .
so we had to carry them from field to our house .

There is a mountain called Misen where a famous Buddhism monk , Kuukai opened a saint place .
Our stomach was not big enough to taste all of them .
They were going to find a good onsen or hot spring the night .
I remembered that an old friend boutht a condo opposite Miyajima recently .
She recommend a good onsen nearby that she just went the previous day .
She never told me what to do but she was helping me make the goals clear and how to accomplish them myself .
We decided which day of the week and what time we talk over the phone on what would be going regularly .
The next day , Hamamatsu friends went to another island named Shodo-shima , and I took a local train back to Kobe .
It cost about 4,000 yen cheaper than shinkansen , but it took over 5 hours .
I could n't buy any food or drink till the second station because of no time .
5 piesces of gum eased me .
I enjoyed myself looking out of the window .
There were lots of green , pink and purple colours in the mountains .
I went back to normal yesterday .
My friends were in Shikoku now and they are going to drop by my place tomorrow .
Next week after this long holiday , they are going to Tohoku , the affected area by the earthquake and tsunami , by that camping car to help them clean the damaged things .

I ca n't seem to be able to go to Tokyo this time .
Luckily , she came to Kyoto for a four-day trip this Monday , so I went to see her yesterday .
There is a famous temple named of 東 寺 ( Toji ) near Kyoto station , and a big antique market is held on 21st of every month .
Yesterday was the day .
We met at the station about 10 : 30 and walked there .
There were lots of people gathering and lots of stores selling old kimonos , foods , hand crafts as well as antiques .
I found an interesting carved ornament which was 38,000 yen .
We walked around for a while , however , there were too many people and too many things to have a careful look .
We joined them at once .
I thought that was why it was popular .
There were chairs to sit .
A foreign couple were sharing a piece sitting next us .
She seemed to have hated it .
We also enjoyed seeing lots of statues inside the builidngs of the temple that showed 曼 荼 羅 ( Mandala ) or Buddhism 's heaven and earth .
One of the statues named 帝 釈 天 ( Taishaku-ten ) riding an elephant was really handsome .
I did n't know that it was built as a grave of some saints and it was burnt out four times after it was first built in 883 but it never collapsed by earthquakes .
Before leaving there early 4 : 00 , I dropped by the store again to just see the carved ornament once again , and then , surprisingly , the shope person started to give me a discount .
Before leaving there early 4 : 00 , I dropped by the store again to just see the carved ornament once again , and then , surprisingly , the shope person started to give me a discount .
He said , " It is very good , but you can buy it for 8,000 yen. " I could n't belive it because he was going to make it 30,000 yen cheaper .
He said , " It is very good , but you can buy it for 8,000 yen. " I could n't belive it because he was going to make it 30,000 yen cheaper .
I started to check it carefully , and then he even said , " OK , it 's just 7,000 yen .
Please take it. " How can you discount 31,000 yen ?
I talked to myself , " Perhaps , it was not as good as the price from the beginning. " Customer 's mind , it 's funny , is n't it ?
We took a train this time on the way back to the station , we rode only one-station distance , though .
After buying 駅 弁 ( ekiben ) or colourful delicioius meal in a box , we talked again about the future planning at a cafe for a while .
We had a really good time and said good-bye about 5 : 30 p.m .
I would really appreciate if you correct wrong usages and unnatural expressions of mine .
I thought it was just 'tissues ' even though it is pocket-sized , but I was not sure then .
How about the case of tissues , which is made of bamboo , plastic or wood ?
It 's a lovely weekend today .

According to an korean article , 40 percentage of overweight people are in the world and the number is increase rapidly .

After then , make a list a diet card and put it on a fridge .
They can check daily intake of foods .
It is essential to pretect gluttony .
Second , they need to exercise regulary .
the expert say that only law calorie food is not enough to lose weight .
Exercise and diet food sould go hand in hand .
However , some of fatness people avoid physical exercise because , they get diseases alredy such as hypertension and rheumatism .

Do you think Japanese government should accept more immigrants ?
I agree with the statement that Japanese should accept more immigrants from abroad to solve problems of declining birthrate and aging population .
A number of immigrants want jobs in Japan and they work hard because they want to make change .
However in other ways , for example , raising taxes would end up to force people live less happily .
I do n't want to work after I get 65 yeas old because of lack of the savings and decreased pension .
On the contrary , what is the problem of accepting more immigrants ?
These problems are not big deal .
We will be able to solve them by discussing and understanding of cultural differences of each other .
All in all , immigrants are powerful solution for aging society .
Japanese government should change the policy .
Talking with foreigners is much fun !
Why do n't we live together and make wonderful life with cultural exchange ?

We wish his every success in his new job as well as his health .

Gave the lawn a fertilizer
First , about 10 gram powder of urea fertilizer , which is two or three scoops by a tablespoon , was solved and diluted to 5 litters of water in a watering pot .
And the dilute solution of the fertilizer was given to the lawn , 2 to 3 litters per a square meters .
This urea fertilizer is very efficient for the growth of the grass , especially good for greening the leaves .

When I am running , I can have my own time for only myself .
It probably means we will feel hard in the 42.195km , that means a full marathon , of course , but it is very short time compared with whole life , so it is short enough to bear it , or it is very short to enjoy it .
The marathon race is the Kintarou Marathon .

If you communicate with someone , you share and exchange informations with them .
The mutual communication is much better than the one-way communication , I think .
Mutual communications would bring us many worth things such as mutual understanding , happy feelings , smile , love , new ideas , and something better like that than one-way communication do .
If you want to make a mutual communication with someone , you can start by saying hello with warm smile to them at first .
At this site lang8 , to write a entry , make a correction or leave a comment on it , and reply to the comment or leave back another correction on their entries is a kind of great mutual communication .
I did not reply to all of your corrections and comments at lang8 .

The measurement way is called " Kazoe-toshi. "
This time my Yakudoshi is the age of 41 to 43 , form Mae-yaku to Ato-yaku .
It finished the day before yesterday , my 43rd birthday .
I did't experience any misfortunes or illness during my Yaku-doshi years .
This is a Japanese belief that people at the ages of yakudoshi are likely to experience misfortunes or illness .
Second , as a husband , I was not very good husband.. .
Next , as a runner , I enjoyed running .
I ran for more than 2000 miles of total distance this year .
I should have done more exercises with balls .
As a engineer , I was as usually I am .
It was an ordinary year as usual .
We have something good and something not good this year .
Anyway , we laughed and smiled happily very many times .
I have a summer vacation for a week from tomorrow .
Unfortunately my wife will not have days off next week , so we ca n't go on a trip to somewhere very far away .

We had a welcome party for me yesterday night .
I had moved to another department in my office on April 16th .
My new coworkers held the party for welcoming me .
Younger coworkers are in the new department , so more cheerful the party was than my old department .
There was a unique meal there .
That is deep fried gingers .
Have you ever eaten them ?
I ate them for the first time .
It was delicious more than expected .
We had a couple of very happy times at the bar while chatting casually since we had known each other with most of my new coworkers for some time .
I was very happy to be welcomed and felt grateful for them .

It is dizzylingly hot .
In the city , there are the heat island phenomena .
The heat wind is breezing instead of the cozy cool wind .
Have you ever felt your losing of motivation after a big goal ?
It is weird that I do n't think I can keep my motivation high after my big goal which is the completion of my first ultra marathon achieved on two weeks ago .
I do n't want to run after that as well as before .
Perhaps I might have got a burn-out syndrome or something like that .
Have you ever felt yourself like this ?
I have read a like story on a book by Haruki Murakami .
Probably it maybe partly because of the physical fatigue , including the visceral fatigue .
The instinct might force me taking a rest for recovering my whole body .
Anyway , It is a very interesting experience .
I will take a good rest for recovering my body for some time in order to enjoy myself running again .
There is just a month left till the end of this year .
Time does fly actually .

To tell the truth , some of the power cuts were cancelled by saving electricity consumption .
I think we will have them at least in spring and summer .
We have the irregular and stressful life cycle for a while to make Japan recover quickly .
What we can do right now by each of ourselves is what we have to do right now for immediate recovering .

The team is belonging to a Kanagawa prefecture amateur senior soccer league .
At the senior league , only the senior players of over 40 years old can play .
At the annual meeting , we discussed the activities , including the game results and the budget in the last year and made the plan for the coming year , while talking about old and new staffs , way of managements , game tactics and so on .
The meeting was held at a party room in an Izakaya for about an hour without drinking , it was surprising for us .
It was very worthy meeting .
And thereafter , we slipped into a party with alcohol .
It was very fun .
We drank very much and enjoyed talking about our soccer and also about something else .
I wonder why athletes drink much .
At least many athletes who I know of .

Electric fans do great job and play great roles in this season and coming summer .
However , the rainy season here in Kanagawa , Japan will be end in a few days .
I think it will be the next week .
I love summer of course , but in this summer I am worrying about the electricity saving .
Less light is rather good , but less air conditioner is not good especially for weak people , for example , the old , the baby and the sick .
It 's said that good fortune will be gone if you speak .
I spent watching some dramas and movies recorded on the HDD recorder .
I watched " 500 days of summer " and " Solanine " which is one of Japanese movies , and so on .
I did not do any housework and did refresh myself by thoroughly lazy resting .
I could probably completely refreshed myself now .
In these days , I have been repairing the lawn in the garden .
It was a kind of cooler climate lawn for autumn and winter season .
I have been repairing with another kind of hotter climate lawn for summer season .
It grows very faster in this hot summer .
I tell you how I repair the lawn .
Well , now I get it started .
First , cut the straws from the summer kind lawn grass for about 5cm , and second , put them in holes picked in the garden .
And then , water the straws every afternoon .
Several days later , almost all the picked straw will root and grow .
No need to pay more money .
Why do n't you try ?
It is a kind of fire festivals to worship traveler 's guardian deities which called as 'Doso-jin' .
It is held here and there in rural area in Japan on the little New Year ( January 15th or during14th and 16th by the lunar calendar ) .
It is said that we can avoid getting diseases if we eat rice cakes which baked in the fire , and we can improve calligraphy skill if the fire rise high .

Difficulty of timely corrections on journals
I think it is difficult to make corrections on others ' journals timely .
I want to make corrections and comments on journals to help studying languages to each other and to make friends with each other .
Whenever I want to do so , someone have already made corrections on them .
I do n't think it is good to write same corrections as former 's , so I am sorry but I can not make corrections adding to them .
It 's likely a kind of competition .
It is surely difficult to make an original correction on someone 's journal very timely .
Have you ever feel these difficulties like me ?
That is based on the novel originally written by Kanae Minato .
It 's a revenge story of one junior high school teacher whose daughter was killed his pupils .
The story mainly consists of the confessions of some characters .
She , who is a teacher , a mother and became a revenger , revenges on the killers for her daughter in the very psychologically terrible way .
It was a horrible story , not a happy story .
No one could become happy , even the revenger mother and the revenged killers .
One killer , who is a junior high school student , has his own story why he killed a little girl .
And the other killer , who is a classmate of him , has another story .
I do n't recommend the movie to all people , especially to parents who have school kids .
But It would make you think if the school life of your kids may be okay .
It was only a non fiction story , but was psychologically horrible enough .
I hope like this story will not happen in real world .
Anyway , nevertheless , I enjoyed the movie .
How do you like movies of this kind ?
It was an excellent weather for running marathon .
Fuji which is now capped with snow , and the other mountains colored various colors of fall leaves .
The 1st half of this race , I ran fun but too fast .
This caused the speed down of the 2nd half .
I got a stomach muscle spasm around 25km .
It was a little serious for running .
The toughest one in a year , I think it was .

I am looking for the next one even the current one has only just finished .
I make it a rule to do some routines in the new year 's holidays .
On the first day , I run to the top of a mountain nearby to see the first sunrise with friends .
Then , I walk up to the temple to wish a nice year with family .
On the second day , we visit my wife 's parents for New Year 's greeting .
And we go to cheer the Hakone Ekiden Relay Race .
And we go to watch the High School Soccer Championship games at the stadium .
And then , we go shopping at Yokohama midtown .
On the third day , I run to cheer the Hakone Race again alone .
I spend somewhat busy holidays .
Note everything down on notebooks
We always think of many things of various kinds .
Coming up with good ideas , having a brainstorm alone , thinking of a right words or phrases , and so on .
And , it 's a pity that we can not keep all of them in our mind or we can not remember what good ideas we think up a just while ago .
And , it 's a pity that we can not keep all of them in our mind or we can not remember what good ideas we think up a just while ago .
We would forget most things because our brains do n't have infinite capacities .
Yes , probably it is for us , at least for me certainly .
Do n't you think it is good if we could remember every good ideas we had thought of ?
What should we do for that ?
What we should do for that is to note everything down on notebooks .
Bringing notebook with us anytime anywhere , we note down anything you see , hear , feel , and good ideas , even not good ideas , everything .
Bringing notebook with us anytime anywhere , we note down anything you see , hear , feel , and good ideas , even not good ideas , everything .
Fortunately , notebooks are not so expensive , easy to get at stationary shops , convenience stores , and so on .
And they have infinite capacities if we want .
When we fill up a notebook , we can just use the next new one .
When we fill up a notebook , we can just use the next new one .

The river is famous for sweetfish fishing .
They fish by decoy in the center of the river at waist level of water with very long fishing rods .
They are lead to invade the turf of some other sweetfish of target and the invaded one attack the decoy to be hooked .
That is the way of fishing sweetfish by decoy as well as I know .
I have never fished sweetfish by decoy .
Many fishers and very long rods in the river is a beautiful scenery in summer .

Excursion with my son ?
My son and I took the same train to commute yesterday morning .
I went to the head office of my company in central Tokyo for business meeting .
I took the train which my son took to his university .
There was no seat for two of us , but only room for one .
The train was getting crowded more and more as it went to central Tokyo .
After that , he got off and changed at Shimokitazawa Station to his train to school .
I also changed at the next station to my head office .
It was only one of daily scenes .
They were set in splints not to fall down by the wind or anything .
I am looking forward it growing up , getting blooming and fruiting .
The zero point was close to the 311 's one .
Here also quaked about intensity 3 .
I do n't know of the damages caused of it .

Yesterday was the no overtime day of my office .
So I left my office out as soon as possible to run to see cherry blossoms in the dusk .
We spend a long time very happily together .

Some years ago , she completely forgot the day was a day of our anniversary .
I love her something like that , too .
I found two big male Japanese pheasants at the riverbank path on the way to work yesterday .
It seemed about two feet from head to tail .
They have beautiful read heads and long tails .
There are many kinds of wild birds around the river which bank I run as a home course .
Some kinds of herons , geese , and so on , I do n't know their names .

That happened yesterday at the game between Germany and England .
The ball shot by a attacking player hit the crossbar and bounced into the goal once and bounced back outside to the goal keeper .
However , the referee did n't recognize the goal by mistake .
Referees of the world level seldom make a mistake , but not never unfortunately .
That 's why many things are interesting and exciting .
At the same card in 1966 , that was interesting , German verses England , on the contrary , the referee misjudged the goal for actual no goal .
This has been called " Suspicious goal. "
The play with no goal at yesterday 's game will be called " Suspicious no-goal , " from now on , I think .
One of my friends is now trying to run 100 marathons on every single day during 100 days .

Very exciting plays were seen during the 1st half of the match .
These were very speedy and powerful .
The splendid goals were shot scored by Netherlands .
and Uruguay respectively .
Soon the 2nd half is to be kicked off .

I am very sorry to complain this time .
I am not a kind of complainers .
Just this time .
By the way , It is about my working environment .
I do n't like it very much , even say I ca n't almost put up with it .
There are much unpleasant noise and smell from my coworkers... .
My left neighbor makes loud noise of chewing gums every time .
One on my right are constantly murmuring , saying to himself .
One on my behind makes loud noise of his broken computer fan that is rotating at the maximum speed all the time .
And the one next to the behind wears a lot of perfume .
it 's not so bad smell but too much enough for me to dislike it .
They prevent me from concentrating on my deskwork at my desk
I work on my computer set on my desk , so I ca n't escape from my desk to another place , for example , to a library or a meeting room .
I put earplugs into my ears all the day to concentrate on my work .
I wonder what I can do for that working environment .
I am making a plan to change it there or escape from there .
